# Project Highlight: Intelligent Web Scraping System
**Emmett Maher** | Production Data Pipeline for AI Knowledge Bases

## The Challenge

Build a cost-effective system to maintain up-to-date product catalogs (8,000+ products) from e-commerce sites for AI conversational agents, with frequent updates and budget constraints.

**Timeline:** Oct 2024 - Oct 2025 (evolved in 3 phases: Foundation â†’ Production â†’ Optimization)

---

## The Decision

**Option A:** Use Firecrawl's turnkey LLMs-full solution
- Simple integration (1 hour setup)
- **Cost: $3,500+/year** (full site rescans)
- No incremental updates or change detection

**Option B:** Build intelligent custom system
- 10 hours development investment
- **Cost: $50-80/year** (95% reduction)
- Real-time change detection, incremental updates

**Choice:** Built custom. **ROI: 2 months**

---

## Key Innovations

### 1. Webhook-Driven Architecture
Real-time monitoring triggers scraping only when pages actually change, not on a schedule.

### 2. Intelligent Skip System
Index-based tracking prevents rescaping existing products. **Result: 81% skip rate in testing**

### 3. Discovery-Only Mode
Separate discovery ($3.60) from scraping ($18), enabling budget planning and staged processing.

### 4. Zero-Waste Error Handling
Failed URLs go to retry queue for manual review instead of automatic retries. Prevents credit waste on persistently bad URLs.

### 5. RAG-Optimized Output
124 category-based shard files vs. one massive file. AI agents load only relevant data.

## Technical Highlights

**API Strategy:**
- MAP API for structure discovery (cheap)
- SCRAPE API for content extraction (targeted)
- Proactive rate limiting (1s delays) prevents 429 errors

**State Management:**
- Manifest (URL â†’ shard mapping)
- Index (fast existence lookup)
- Pending queue (resumable operations)
- Retry queue (failure isolation)

**Production Features:**
- Comprehensive logging (discovery/batch summaries)
- Triple backup system (git tag + branch + filesystem)
- 7 documentation guides
- GitHub Actions automation

## Results

| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cost Savings** | $3,400+/year (95% reduction) |
| **Products Processed** | 5,828+ and growing |
| **Skip Efficiency** | 81% (only scrapes what's needed) |
| **Organized Shards** | 124 category-based files |
| **Sites Supported** | 2 (easily extensible) |
| **Development Time** | 10 hours â†’ infinite reuse |

## Business Impact

**Quantitative:**
- ROI: 340x in first year
- Ongoing operational cost: <$5/month
- Scalable to unlimited sites with same infrastructure

**Qualitative:**
- Production-ready reliability (retry queue, rate limiting)
- Maintainable (comprehensive docs, clean code)
- Reusable platform (not just a one-off solution)

## Skills Demonstrated

âœ… **System Design** - Build vs. buy analysis, cost optimization  
âœ… **Problem Solving** - Root cause analysis (index desync, rate limiting)  
âœ… **Production Mindset** - Logging, backups, documentation  
âœ… **Business Awareness** - ROI analysis, budget controls  
âœ… **API Integration** - Firecrawl, GitHub Actions, ElevenLabs  
âœ… **State Management** - Multi-file consistency, atomic operations

## Key Insight

> "The most valuable engineering skill isn't knowing how to write code - it's knowing when to write code. This project demonstrates building intelligently on top of the right tools, not reinventing wheels or accepting expensive shortcuts."

---

## Why This Matters

This wasn't just about scraping websites - it was about:
- Understanding cost models and optimizing accordingly
- Designing resilient systems that handle failure gracefully
- Building reusable platforms that solve classes of problems
- Communicating technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders

**The 10-hour investment will return 340x in year one, while providing a foundation for unlimited future sites.**
