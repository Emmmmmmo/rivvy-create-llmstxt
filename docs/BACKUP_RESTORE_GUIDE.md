# Backup & Restore Guide

Created: October 5, 2025, 22:33:23

## 🔐 Backup Summary

Three backup methods have been created before merging `feature/mydiy-batch-scrape` to `main`:

---

## 📦 Backup 1: Git Tag (Recommended for Git Restore)

**Tag Name:** `v1.1-pre-merge-backup`

**What's Backed Up:**
- All committed code from `feature/mydiy-batch-scrape`
- 9 files: updated script + 7 new documentation files
- Commit hash: `4e68369`

**Restore Command:**
```bash
# View the backup
git show v1.1-pre-merge-backup

# Restore to this exact state
git checkout v1.1-pre-merge-backup

# Or create a new branch from backup
git checkout -b restored-from-backup v1.1-pre-merge-backup
```

**Remote Location:** 
- GitHub: https://github.com/Emmmmmmo/rivvy-create-llmstxt/releases/tag/v1.1-pre-merge-backup

---

## 🌿 Backup 2: Git Branch

**Branch Name:** `backup/pre-merge-20251005-223303`

**What's Backed Up:**
- Identical to git tag
- Alternative restore method

**Restore Command:**
```bash
# Switch to backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-merge-20251005-223303

# Or merge backup into current branch
git merge backup/pre-merge-20251005-223303
```

**Remote Location:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/Emmmmmmo/rivvy-create-llmstxt/tree/backup/pre-merge-20251005-223303

---

## 💾 Backup 3: Local Filesystem Archive (Complete State)

**File:** `rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-20251005-223323.tar.gz`

**Location:** `/Users/emmettmaher/Documents/Projects/Rivvy/`

**Size:** 4.1 MB

**What's Backed Up:**
- ✅ ALL committed code
- ✅ Uncommitted changes (out/.DS_Store)
- ✅ Test data (out/mydiy-ie/ with 5,828 products)
- ✅ Queue data (pending-queue.json with 10 URLs)
- ✅ Test logs (ladders_full_test.log)
- ✅ Helper scripts (scrape_all_mydiy_categories.sh)
- ✅ Git history (partial - excludes large objects)

**Restore Command:**
```bash
# Extract to new location
cd /Users/emmettmaher/Documents/Projects/Rivvy/
tar -xzf rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-20251005-223323.tar.gz -C restored/

# Or extract to current location (BE CAREFUL - will overwrite!)
# tar -xzf rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-20251005-223323.tar.gz
```

## 📊 Current State at Backup Time

### Git Status:
```
Branch: feature/mydiy-batch-scrape
Committed: 9 files (script + docs)
Uncommitted: 
  - out/.DS_Store (modified)
  - out/mydiy-ie/ (untracked - 124 shards, 5,828 products)
  - ladders_full_test.log (untracked)
  - scripts/scrape_all_mydiy_categories.sh (untracked)
```

### Key Features Added:
- `--discovery-only` flag
- `--hierarchical` discovery mode
- Retry queue system
- API rate limiting
- Enhanced logging
- URL deduplication
- Skip system improvements

### Test Results:
- ✅ Ladders category: 5 new products scraped
- ✅ Skip system: 22/27 URLs properly skipped
- ✅ Queue system: 10 URLs queued from power-tools
- ✅ No breaking changes

## 🔄 Restore Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Merge Failed, Need to Rollback"

**If merge created conflicts:**
```bash
# Abort the merge
git merge --abort

# You're back on feature branch, safe
git status
```

**If merge completed but has issues:**
```bash
# Undo the merge (keeps history)
git revert -m 1 HEAD

# Or hard reset (removes merge from history)
git reset --hard v1.1-pre-merge-backup
git push origin main --force  # ⚠️ Only if needed!
```

---

### Scenario 2: "Need to Restore Test Data"

```bash
cd /Users/emmettmaher/Documents/Projects/Rivvy/
tar -xzf rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-20251005-223323.tar.gz \
  --strip-components=1 \
  rivvy-create-llmstxt/out/mydiy-ie
```

This extracts only the `out/mydiy-ie/` directory with all test data.

---

### Scenario 3: "Want to Compare Before/After Merge"

```bash
# Compare current state with backup
git diff v1.1-pre-merge-backup

# Compare specific file
git diff v1.1-pre-merge-backup -- scripts/update_llms_agnostic.py

# View what changed in merge
git log v1.1-pre-merge-backup..main --oneline
```

---

### Scenario 4: "Complete Disaster Recovery"

```bash
# Delete everything and restore from filesystem backup
cd /Users/emmettmaher/Documents/Projects/Rivvy/
rm -rf rivvy-create-llmstxt/  # ⚠️ Nuclear option!
tar -xzf rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-20251005-223323.tar.gz
cd rivvy-create-llmstxt/
git status  # Check state
```

---

## ✅ Verification Commands

### Verify Git Tag Exists:
```bash
git tag -l | grep v1.1-pre-merge-backup
```

### Verify Backup Branch Exists:
```bash
git branch -a | grep backup/pre-merge
```

### Verify Filesystem Backup:
```bash
ls -lh /Users/emmettmaher/Documents/Projects/Rivvy/rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-*.tar.gz
```

### Test Filesystem Backup Integrity:
```bash
tar -tzf /Users/emmettmaher/Documents/Projects/Rivvy/rivvy-create-llmstxt-backup-20251005-223323.tar.gz | head -20
```

## 🎯 Recommended Restore Strategy

**For code issues:**
1. Use Git Tag: `git checkout v1.1-pre-merge-backup`
2. Fast, clean, version-controlled

**For data recovery:**
1. Use Filesystem Archive: Extract specific directories
2. Preserves all test data and uncommitted work

**For complete recovery:**
1. Clone fresh from GitHub
2. Extract filesystem backup for test data
3. Safest approach

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Git backups** (tag + branch) are on GitHub - accessible from anywhere
- **Filesystem backup** is local only - consider uploading to cloud storage
- **Test data** (out/mydiy-ie/) is only in filesystem backup
- All backups are from commit `4e68369` on `feature/mydiy-batch-scrape`

---

## ⚠️ Important

Before deleting any backup:
1. Verify merge is stable
2. Test production for at least 24 hours
3. Confirm no regression issues
4. Keep filesystem backup for at least 30 days

---

## 🚀 Safe to Proceed with Merge

All backups are in place. You can now safely:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/mydiy-batch-scrape
git push origin main
```

If anything goes wrong, you have THREE ways to restore! 🎉
