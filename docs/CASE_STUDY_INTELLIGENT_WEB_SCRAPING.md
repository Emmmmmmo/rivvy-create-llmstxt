# Case Study: Building an Intelligent Web Scraping System
**A Production-Ready Solution for E-Commerce Data Management**

**Author:** Emmett Maher  
**Project:** Rivvy LLMs.txt Generator  
**Timeline:** October 2024 - October 2025  
**Technologies:** Python, Firecrawl API, GitHub Actions, Webhooks

---

## Executive Summary

When faced with maintaining up-to-date product catalogs from multiple e-commerce sites for AI knowledge bases, I had two paths: use existing SaaS solutions with ongoing costs of $3,500+/year, or invest development time into a custom system. I chose the latter, building an intelligent scraping system that reduced operational costs by 95% while providing superior functionality.

**Result:** A production-ready data pipeline that saves $3,400+ annually, processes 8,000+ products intelligently, and has become a reusable platform for unlimited sites.

---

## Project Evolution

This project developed in phases, with each phase building on learnings from production usage:

**Phase 1 (October 2024): Foundation**
- Core scraping functionality with Firecrawl API
- Webhook integration (Rivvy-Observer) for change detection
- GitHub Actions automation
- ElevenLabs knowledge base sync
- Basic shard-based organization

**Phase 2 (Early 2025): Production Hardening**
- Index/manifest system for state management
- Queue-based processing
- Error handling and retry logic
- Comprehensive logging

**Phase 3 (October 2025): Cost Optimization**
- Discovery-only mode (separate discovery from scraping)
- Hierarchical discovery (4-level site structure understanding)
- Intelligent skip system (81% efficiency)
- Zero-retry strategy with dedicated retry queue
- Enhanced rate limiting and timeout configuration

**Key Insight:** Each phase was driven by real production needs, not premature optimization. The recent cost optimizations came from actually running the system and identifying opportunities for improvement.

## The Problem: More Complex Than It Appears

### Initial Requirements
- **Scope:** Scrape and maintain product catalogs from e-commerce sites (8,000+ products)
- **Purpose:** Feed structured data to AI agents (ElevenLabs conversational AI)
- **Challenge:** Products change frequently - new items, price updates, descriptions
- **Constraint:** Budget-conscious - API costs matter at scale

### The Hidden Complexity

What seemed like a simple scraping task revealed deeper challenges:

1. **Incremental Updates:** Full site rescans are expensive and wasteful
2. **Change Detection:** Need to know WHAT changed, not just IF something changed
3. **Organization:** 8,000 products in one file is unusable for RAG systems
4. **Resilience:** API failures shouldn't waste credits or require manual intervention
5. **Scale:** Solution must work for multiple sites, not just one
6. **Integration:** Data must flow automatically to downstream systems

---

## Decision Point: Build vs. Buy

### Option 1: Firecrawl's LLMs-Full Endpoint

**The Simple Approach:**
```python
# One API call to crawl entire site
POST /v2/crawl {
  "url": "https://www.mydiy.ie",
  "scrapeOptions": { "formats": ["llms-full"] }
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Pros:** Simple, turnkey solution, works immediately
- ❌ **Cons:** 
  - $72 per full crawl
  - No incremental updates (must rescrape everything)
  - No change detection (can't identify what changed)
  - Flat structure (poor for RAG queries)
  - **Projected cost:** $3,500+/year for weekly updates

### Option 2: Custom Intelligent System

**The Engineering Investment:**

Build a system that:
- Detects changes in real-time via webhooks
- Scrapes only what changed (incremental updates)
- Maintains an index to prevent redundant scraping
- Organizes data into category-based shards
- Handles failures gracefully with retry queues

**Analysis:**
- ❌ **Initial cost:** 8-10 hours development time
- ✅ **Ongoing cost:** ~$2-5/month (95% reduction)
- ✅ **ROI:** Pays for itself in 2 months

## The Solution: An Intelligent Data Pipeline

I chose to build. Here's what makes the system "intelligent" rather than just another scraper:

### 1. Real-Time Change Detection (Rivvy-Observer Integration)

**Problem:** How do you know when a product page changes?

**Traditional approach:** Poll the site daily/hourly
- Inefficient (check even when nothing changed)
- Delayed (miss changes between polls)
- Expensive (API calls for comparison)

**My approach:** Webhook-driven architecture
```python
# External service monitors site → Sends webhook on change
# GitHub Actions receives webhook → Triggers scraper
# System processes ONLY changed pages
```

**Result:** React to changes in minutes, not hours. Zero API calls wasted on unchanged pages.

### 2. Hierarchical Discovery (Understanding Site Structure)

**Problem:** E-commerce sites have deep hierarchies (Main Category → Subcategory → Product Category → Product)

**Traditional approach:** Flat crawl of all URLs
- No understanding of site structure
- Difficult to organize output
- Hard to resume if interrupted

**My approach:** 4-level hierarchical discovery
```python
Level 1: MAP API → Discover main categories (21 categories)
Level 2: SCRAPE API → Find subcategories (37 found)
Level 3: SCRAPE API → Locate product categories (315 found)
Level 4: SCRAPE API → Extract product data (8,000+ products)
```

**Result:** Structured data organization matching business logic. Can process one category at a time or resume mid-operation.

### 3. Intelligent Skip System (Index-Based Deduplication)

**Problem:** How do you avoid scraping the same product twice?

**Traditional approach:** No tracking, resccrape everything
- Wasteful API usage
- Expensive at scale
- Unnecessary load

**My approach:** Persistent index with two-phase checking
```python
# Phase 1: Discovery
discovered_urls = find_product_urls(category)
for url in discovered_urls:
    if url in existing_index:
        skip(url)  # No API call!
    else:
        queue(url)  # Process later

# Phase 2: Scraping
for entry in queue:
    if entry.url in existing_index:  # Double-check
        skip(entry)
    else:
        scrape(entry)  # Make API call
        existing_index.add(entry.url)
```

**Real result:** During testing, system skipped 22 of 27 URLs (81% skip rate). **Saved ~$0.20 in that batch alone.**

### 4. Discovery-Only Mode (Budget Control)

**Problem:** Need to know the full scope before committing budget

**Traditional approach:** Start scraping and hope for the best

**My approach:** Separate discovery from scraping
```bash
# Phase 1: Discovery only (~$3.60)
python update_llms_agnostic.py --hierarchical https://site.com/ --discovery-only

# Review queue: 2,000 products found
jq '.pending | length' pending-queue.json

# Phase 2: Process queue in controlled batches (~$18)
python update_llms_agnostic.py --process-queue-only --batch-size 50 --max-batches 40
```

**Result:** Can discover entire catalog for $3.60, review what will be scraped, then make informed decision on budget allocation.

### 5. Retry Queue (Zero-Waste Error Handling)

**Problem:** Network timeouts, rate limits, and transient failures waste API credits

**Traditional approach:** Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Often retries same failing URLs repeatedly
- Wastes credits on persistently bad URLs
- Hard to identify systemic issues

**My approach:** Zero automatic retries + dedicated retry queue
```python
try:
    data = scrape_with_api(url)
except Exception as error:
    retry_queue.add({
        "url": url,
        "error": str(error),
        "timestamp": now(),
        "attempts": 0
    })
    # NO automatic retry!
```

**Result:** Failed URLs go to separate queue for manual review. Can identify patterns (e.g., specific category timing out), fix root cause, then retry efficiently.

### 6. Shard-Based Organization (RAG-Optimized Output)

**Problem:** Single 8,000-product file is unwieldy for AI systems

**Traditional approach:** One massive markdown file

**My approach:** Category-based shards
```
out/mydiy-ie/
├── llms-mydiy-ie-power_tools.txt (2,500 products)
├── llms-mydiy-ie-hand_tools.txt (1,800 products)
├── llms-mydiy-ie-garden_tools.txt (1,200 products)
└── ... (124 shards total)
```

**Result:** RAG systems can load relevant shards only. AI agent answering "show me cordless drills" loads 1 shard (~50KB) instead of entire catalog (15MB).

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### API Strategy: MAP for Discovery, SCRAPE for Content

**Insight:** Firecrawl has two complementary APIs with different strengths

- **MAP API:** Fast site structure discovery, returns URLs only
- **SCRAPE API:** Detailed content extraction, supports custom schemas

**My approach:** Use each for its strength
```python
# Cheap structure discovery
subcategories = map_api(main_category)  # 1 API call → 37 URLs

# Expensive content extraction only when needed
for subcategory in subcategories:
    products = scrape_api(subcategory)  # Targeted scraping
    for product in products:
        if product.url not in index:
            detailed_data = scrape_api(product.url, schema=PRODUCT_SCHEMA)
```

**Result:** Optimal API usage - don't pay for full content when only structure is needed.

### Rate Limiting: Proactive vs. Reactive

**Challenge:** Firecrawl API has rate limits (429 errors)

**Traditional approach:** Handle 429 errors when they occur (reactive)

**My approach:** Prevent them from happening (proactive)
```python
# Add 1-second delay between ALL API calls
time.sleep(1)

# Set timeouts to prevent hanging
timeout=60  # for SCRAPE operations
timeout=90  # for MAP operations
```

**Result:** Zero 429 errors in production. Predictable, reliable operation.

### State Management: Manifest + Index + Queue

**Challenge:** Resume operations after interruption, track progress

**My approach:** Triple-file state management
```python
manifest.json      # What URLs map to which shard files
index.json         # Set of all scraped URLs (fast lookup)
pending-queue.json # URLs waiting to be scraped
retry-queue.json   # Failed URLs for manual review
```

**Result:** Can stop/resume at any point. Full audit trail of all operations.

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Index Desynchronization

**Problem discovered:** Index and manifest got out of sync, causing skip system to fail

**Root cause:** Separate file updates weren't atomic

**Solution implemented:**
```python
def rebuild_index_from_manifest():
    """Ensure index stays synchronized with manifest"""
    index = set()
    for shard in manifest.values():
        for entry in shard:
            index.add(entry['url'])
    save_index(index)
```

**Lesson learned:** State management requires active synchronization, not just persistence.

### Challenge 2: Rate Limiting at Scale

**Problem discovered:** Rapid API calls caused 429 errors during discovery

**Initial approach:** Exponential backoff on errors (reactive)

**Better solution:** Proactive rate limiting
```python
# Before every API call
time.sleep(1)  # Simple, predictable, effective
```

**Lesson learned:** Preventing problems is better than handling them.

### Challenge 3: Level 2 Discovery Finding 0 Categories

**Problem discovered:** MAP API found 7 categories, but site actually had 9

**Investigation:** MAP doesn't crawl JavaScript-rendered navigation

**Solution:** Switched to SCRAPE API for Level 2
```python
# MAP for Level 1 (site structure, fast)
main_categories = map_api(site_url)

# SCRAPE for Level 2 (renders JavaScript, complete)
subcategories = scrape_api(category_url, format="links")
```

**Lesson learned:** Different APIs have different rendering capabilities. Choose appropriately per use case.

## Technical Decisions & Tradeoffs

### Decision 1: Python Over Node.js

**Rationale:**
- Rich ecosystem for data processing (pandas, json manipulation)
- Strong typing available (type hints)
- Better for scripting and automation
- Team familiarity

**Tradeoff:** Node.js might have been faster for async operations, but Python's clarity and tooling won out.

### Decision 2: GitHub Actions Over AWS Lambda

**Rationale:**
- Already using GitHub for version control
- Free tier generous for our usage
- Easy integration with Rivvy-Observer webhooks
- No cold start issues (workflows run when triggered)

**Tradeoff:** Less control over execution environment, but deployment simplicity was more valuable.

### Decision 3: JSON Files Over Database

**Rationale:**
- Simple to inspect and debug (cat file.json | jq)
- Git-trackable (can see history of changes)
- No database infrastructure to maintain
- Sufficient performance for our scale

**Tradeoff:** Would need database for millions of products, but JSON is perfect for thousands.

### Decision 4: Custom Queue Over SQS/Redis

**Rationale:**
- JSON-file based queue sufficient for sequential processing
- No external dependencies
- Easy to inspect and manipulate manually if needed
- Clear audit trail

**Tradeoff:** Can't distribute across workers, but don't need that capability yet.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Understand the Cost Model Deeply

Initial assumption: "Scraping is scraping, it's all the same"

Reality: API costs compound quickly at scale
- Discovery vs. content extraction have different costs
- Avoiding redundant calls pays for itself rapidly
- Budget control features (discovery-only) enable better planning

**Takeaway:** Cost optimization isn't premature optimization - it's good engineering.

### 2. State Management is Critical

Early mistake: Assumed index and manifest would stay synchronized naturally

Reality: Separate writes need explicit synchronization
- Built index rebuild mechanism
- Added verification commands
- Documented synchronization requirements

**Takeaway:** Distributed state (even across files) requires careful consistency management.

### 3. Logging is Not Optional

Initial approach: Basic logging (errors only)

Evolution: Comprehensive logging at multiple levels
- Discovery summaries (what was found)
- Skip notifications (what was avoided)
- Batch summaries (what was processed)
- Clear visual indicators (📊 ⏭️ ✅ ⚠️)

**Result:** Can debug issues from logs alone, without reproducing

**Takeaway:** Production systems need production-grade observability.

### 4. Documentation is a Feature

Early mistake: "Code is self-documenting"

Reality: Created 7 guide documents
- LOGGING_GUIDE.md (how to interpret logs)
- RETRY_QUEUE_SYSTEM.md (how to handle failures)
- BACKUP_RESTORE_GUIDE.md (disaster recovery)
- And 4 more...

**Result:** Can onboard new team members, or remember my own decisions months later

**Takeaway:** Documentation is part of the deliverable, not an afterthought.

### 5. Test in Production (Safely)

Strategy: Feature branches + git tags + filesystem backups

**Before each major change:**
```bash
git tag -a v1.X-backup -m "Backup before X"
tar -czf backup.tar.gz .
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

**Result:** Can test boldly, rollback confidently

**Takeaway:** Risk mitigation enables faster iteration.

## Future Enhancements

While the current system is production-ready, there are opportunities for further improvement:

### 1. Weekly MAP Verification

**Concept:** Use MAP API weekly to verify completeness
```python
# Once per week
discovered_urls = map_api(site)
missing_urls = discovered_urls - existing_index
if missing_urls:
    log.warning(f"Found {len(missing_urls)} URLs not in index")
    queue_for_scraping(missing_urls)
```

**Benefit:** Safety net to catch products that webhooks miss

**Cost:** ~1 MAP call/week = $0.009/week = $0.47/year

### 2. Parallel Processing

**Current:** Sequential processing (one URL at a time)

**Future:** Parallel workers with rate limiting
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(scrape, url) for url in batch]
    with rate_limiter:  # Ensure 1 req/sec aggregate
        results = [f.result() for f in futures]
```

**Benefit:** 5x faster processing while respecting rate limits

**Complexity:** Requires shared state management

### 3. Diff-Based Content Updates

**Current:** Scrape entire product page on any change

**Future:** Apply diffs for partial updates
```python
if change_type == "content_modified":
    diff = get_diff_from_webhook()
    apply_diff_to_shard(diff)  # Update only changed fields
    # No API call needed!
```

**Benefit:** Even lower API costs for minor updates (price changes)

**Challenge:** Requires robust diff application logic

### 4. Site-Level Analytics Dashboard

**Concept:** Track metrics per site
- Scraping velocity (products/hour)
- API costs per site
- Error rates
- Coverage (products found vs. expected)

**Benefit:** Data-driven optimization decisions

**Implementation:** Simple dashboard using collected logs

## Conclusion

What started as a "simple scraping task" evolved into a production-grade data pipeline that:
- Saves $3,400+ annually in operational costs
- Processes 8,000+ products intelligently
- Serves as a reusable platform for unlimited sites
- Demonstrates strong engineering fundamentals

The key insight: **Investing time in building intelligent systems pays dividends far beyond the initial problem.** 

This wasn't just about scraping a website - it was about understanding cost models, designing resilient systems, and building solutions that scale. The 10 hours invested in development will return 340x in the first year alone, while providing a foundation for future projects.

**Most importantly:** This project taught me that the most valuable engineering skill isn't knowing how to write code - it's knowing when to write code, and when to leverage existing tools. The answer isn't always "build" or "buy" - sometimes it's "build intelligently on top of the right tools."
