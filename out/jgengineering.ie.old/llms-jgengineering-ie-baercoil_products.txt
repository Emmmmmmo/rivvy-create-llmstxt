## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 30 x 2.0 - HSS

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.
