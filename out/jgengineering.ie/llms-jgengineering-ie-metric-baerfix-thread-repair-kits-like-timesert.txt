## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Repair Kit M 8 x 1.25 - ECO

With the BaerFix® thread repair set, damaged M 8 threads can be repaired quickly and easily.

This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm².

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw.

To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts. Use the core drill bit to prepare the core hole and the installation tool to insert the self-tapping thread insert.

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Repair Kit M 8 x 1.25 - ECO

With the BaerFix® thread repair set, damaged M 8 threads can be repaired quickly and easily.

This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm².

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw.

To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts. Use the core drill bit to prepare the core hole and the installation tool to insert the self-tapping thread insert.
