## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 8 x 1.25 - 9 mm - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 8 x 1.25 - 9 mm - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

They replace drills made of conventional tool steel because they have better properties, such as up to four times higher cutting speed. The HSSR- twist drill bit according to DIN 338 are roll-rolled and have a vaporised surface. The cutting direction is right and the point angle is 118°.

They are suitable for drilling steel and cast steel (alloyed and unalloyed), grey cast iron, malleable cast iron, nodular cast iron, sintered iron, nickel silver, graphite, bronze, brass and aluminium .

## BAER HSSR twist drill bit with reduced shank

The design with reduced shank makes it possible to use drills that have a larger diameter than the matching drill chuck. This makes the BAER HSSR twist drill bit suitable for all common hand drills. Please make sure that the drill bit is firmly seated in the drill chuck. The torques to be transmitted should not be underestimated. Pre-drilling may be advisable.

## Metal drill DIN 338, right-hand cutting with taper cone grinding  roll-rolled, high-speed steel (HSS steel)

The material HSS "High Speed Steel" is suitable for general drilling tasks. They replace drills made of conventional tool steel because they have better properties, such as up to four times higher cutting speed. The HSSR- twist drill bit according to DIN 338 are roll-rolled and have a vaporised surface. The cutting direction is right and the point angle is 118°.

They are suitable for drilling steel and cast steel (alloyed and unalloyed), grey cast iron, malleable cast iron, nodular cast iron, sintered iron, nickel silver, graphite, bronze, brass and aluminium .

## BAER HSSR twist drill bit with reduced shank

The design with reduced shank makes it possible to use drills that have a larger diameter than the matching drill chuck. This makes the BAER HSSR twist drill bit suitable for all common hand drills. Please make sure that the drill bit is firmly seated in the drill chuck. The torques to be transmitted should not be underestimated. Pre-drilling may be advisable.

## Description

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 4 x 0.7 - 6 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 5 x 0.8 - 7 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## M5 X 0.8 BAERFIX CUTTING HOLE STST (1-FAL05)

**€181.73** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 5 x 0.8 - 7 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## Description

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 6 x 1.0 - 8 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## M6 X 1.0 BAERFIX CUTTING HOLE STST (1-FAL06)

**€216.50** ~~~~

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 6 x 1.0 - 8 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## Description

These Faithfull high-performance, tungsten carbide tipped drill bits fit into SDS Plus chucks which provide a particularly secure, non-slip grip, that transmits maximum power for rotary percussion drilling, mainly into concrete.

The SDS Plus bits ensure maximum power transmission due to their unique fluted shaft. This effectively removes situations where a perfectly serviceable cutting edge is rendered useless by a worn shank. The SDS Plus system also enables faster changing of drills using a quick-release keyless chuck.

The drill bits are suitable for use in bricks, blocks, concrete containing aggregates, marble, hard stone and other hard masonry materials.

* * *

The Faithfull FAISDS65160 [SDS](https://www.toolbankb2b.com/g/SDS) Drill has a heavy-duty tungsten carbide tip with the following dimensions:

Diameter: 6.5mm

Working Length: 100mm

Overall Length: 160mm

## Description

These high performance Faithfull Tungsten Carbide tipped drill bits fit into 'SDS Plus' chucks which provide a particularly secure non-slip grip that transmits maximum power for rotary percussion drilling, mainly into concrete.

The SDS Plus bits ensure maximum power transmission due to their unique fluted shaft. This effectively removes situations where a perfectly serviceable cutting edge is rendered useless by a worn shank. The SDS Plus system also enables faster changing of drills using a quick release keyless chuck.

The drill bits are suitable for use in bricks, blocks, concrete containing aggregates, marble and hard stone and other hard masonry materials.

* * *

The Faithfull FAISDS8210 SDS Drill has a heavy-duty tungsten carbide tip with the following dimensions:

Diameter: 8mm

Working Length: 150mm

Overall Length: 210mm
