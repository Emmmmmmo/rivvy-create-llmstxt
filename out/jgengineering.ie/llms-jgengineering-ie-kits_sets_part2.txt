## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.25

**€66.61** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.25

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M30 x 3.5 BAER TAP SET

**€141.62** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 30 x 3.5

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 33 x 3.5.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 33.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Repair Kit M 8 x 1.25 - ECO

With the BaerFix® thread repair set, damaged M 8 threads can be repaired quickly and easily.

This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm².

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw.

To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts. Use the core drill bit to prepare the core hole and the installation tool to insert the self-tapping thread insert.
