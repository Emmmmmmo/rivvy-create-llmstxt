## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 6 x 1.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 6 x 1.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 6 x 1.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 6 x 1.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap is equipped with a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## M6 x 1.0 BaerCoil Bottoming Tap (Helicoil Type)

**€11.90** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 6 x 1.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 6 x 1.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 6 x 1.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 6 x 1.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap is equipped with a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 8 x 1.25 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 8 x 1.25. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 8 x 1.25 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 8 x 1.25 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## M8 x 1.25 BaerCoil Bottoming Tap (Helicoil Type)

**€13.96** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 8 x 1.25 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 8 x 1.25. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 8 x 1.25 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 8 x 1.25 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

## BAER Adjustable Tap Wrench - Steel NO. 4 \| M 11-27 \| 7/16-1'' \| G (BSP) 1/4-3/4

* * *

The adjustable steel tap wrench is an operating tool made of tool steel for taps, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. An all-steel tap wrench is ideal when a larger diameter of the threaded hole and thus a higher torque is required. The reason for this is that the higher quality of the cast steel also allows higher forces to be absorbed.

The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the high-quality clamping jaws, handles and geometry, which make the tool extremely stable and very precise to use. They are standardised according to DIN 1814, equipped with hardened clamping jaws and can be adjusted. The term "Tap turning tool" is also used equivalently in everyday life. These holding tools are not only used for thread cutting, because they and are generally used to clamp tools with square ends. For example, screwdrivers, reamers or insertion tools for thread inserts can be clamped. The long levers on both sides support plumb cutting in the bore and easy application of the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. In order to be able to work in hard-to-reach places, one lever can be unscrewed on one side.

### The most important at a glance:

- BAERENSTARK - Our tap wrenchs impress with their resilience and durability. Hardened clamping jaws for a firm grip and high-quality all-steel bodies.
- EXCELLENT QUALITY - At BAER you buy tested tools at bear-strong prices with outstanding precision for durable stability and force absorption!
- EASY TO USE - The tap wrench is characterised by easy handling and good weight distribution.
- APPLICATION - Tap wrenches are used for clamping hand and short machine taps. The adjustable tap wrench is made of tool steel.
- NOTE - The handles of the tap wrench must never be extended. The forces achievable with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

## M9 - M27 ADJUSTABLE STEEL BAER TAP WRENCH -261404087 (P138)

**€89.27** ~~~~

## BAER Adjustable Tap Wrench - Steel NO. 4 \| M 11-27 \| 7/16-1'' \| G (BSP) 1/4-3/4

* * *

The adjustable steel tap wrench is an operating tool made of tool steel for taps, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. An all-steel tap wrench is ideal when a larger diameter of the threaded hole and thus a higher torque is required. The reason for this is that the higher quality of the cast steel also allows higher forces to be absorbed.

The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the high-quality clamping jaws, handles and geometry, which make the tool extremely stable and very precise to use. They are standardised according to DIN 1814, equipped with hardened clamping jaws and can be adjusted. The term "Tap turning tool" is also used equivalently in everyday life. These holding tools are not only used for thread cutting, because they and are generally used to clamp tools with square ends. For example, screwdrivers, reamers or insertion tools for thread inserts can be clamped. The long levers on both sides support plumb cutting in the bore and easy application of the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. In order to be able to work in hard-to-reach places, one lever can be unscrewed on one side.

### The most important at a glance:

- BAERENSTARK - Our tap wrenchs impress with their resilience and durability. Hardened clamping jaws for a firm grip and high-quality all-steel bodies.
- EXCELLENT QUALITY - At BAER you buy tested tools at bear-strong prices with outstanding precision for durable stability and force absorption!
- EASY TO USE - The tap wrench is characterised by easy handling and good weight distribution.
- APPLICATION - Tap wrenches are used for clamping hand and short machine taps. The adjustable tap wrench is made of tool steel.
- NOTE - The handles of the tap wrench must never be extended. The forces achievable with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 24 x 1.5 - LEFT - HSS

* * *

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Cutting dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. This is a left-hand cutting die that can be used to make left-hand thread. Round dies are cylindrical and are used to make external threads in one operation. On the outer casing of the round die there are four holes and a groove which are used to fix the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## MF 24 x 1.5 BAER Round Cutting Die - LEFT - HSS

**€121.25** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 24 x 1.5 - LEFT - HSS

* * *

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Cutting dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. This is a left-hand cutting die that can be used to make left-hand thread. Round dies are cylindrical and are used to make external threads in one operation. On the outer casing of the round die there are four holes and a groove which are used to fix the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF 24 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## MF 24 x 1.5 HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) - LEFT

**€56.78** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF 24 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Taper (No. 1) MF 52 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap taper tap (No. 1) enables you to pre-cut a thread. The advantage of pre-cutting a thread is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The taper tap (No. 1) is marked with a ring and removes approx. 65 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

## MF 52 x 1.5 Baer HSSG Hand Tap Taper (No. 1)

**€266.28** ~~~~

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Taper (No. 1) MF 52 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap taper tap (No. 1) enables you to pre-cut a thread. The advantage of pre-cutting a thread is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The taper tap (No. 1) is marked with a ring and removes approx. 65 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.5

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## MF M22 X 1.5 BAER TAP (120301072)

**€66.61** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.5

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die NPT 1/2 x 14 - HSS

* * *

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or drill press. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.
