They replace drills made of conventional tool steel because they have better properties, such as up to four times higher cutting speed. The HSSR- twist drill bit according to DIN 338 are roll-rolled and have a vaporised surface. The cutting direction is right and the point angle is 118°.

They are suitable for drilling steel and cast steel (alloyed and unalloyed), grey cast iron, malleable cast iron, nodular cast iron, sintered iron, nickel silver, graphite, bronze, brass and aluminium .

## BAER HSSR twist drill bit with reduced shank

The design with reduced shank makes it possible to use drills that have a larger diameter than the matching drill chuck. This makes the BAER HSSR twist drill bit suitable for all common hand drills. Please make sure that the drill bit is firmly seated in the drill chuck. The torques to be transmitted should not be underestimated. Pre-drilling may be advisable.

## Metal drill DIN 338, right-hand cutting with taper cone grinding  roll-rolled, high-speed steel (HSS steel)

The material HSS "High Speed Steel" is suitable for general drilling tasks. They replace drills made of conventional tool steel because they have better properties, such as up to four times higher cutting speed. The HSSR- twist drill bit according to DIN 338 are roll-rolled and have a vaporised surface. The cutting direction is right and the point angle is 118°.

They are suitable for drilling steel and cast steel (alloyed and unalloyed), grey cast iron, malleable cast iron, nodular cast iron, sintered iron, nickel silver, graphite, bronze, brass and aluminium .

## BAER HSSR twist drill bit with reduced shank

The design with reduced shank makes it possible to use drills that have a larger diameter than the matching drill chuck. This makes the BAER HSSR twist drill bit suitable for all common hand drills. Please make sure that the drill bit is firmly seated in the drill chuck. The torques to be transmitted should not be underestimated. Pre-drilling may be advisable.

### Our HSSR twist drill bit are characterised by:

- high breaking strength
- good chip evacuation
- Wear resistance
- Cutting edge stability

This means that BAER HSSR twist drill bit made of high-speed steel HSS can also cope with many material requirements. Precise work and long-term cost savings are added to this.
