## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 12 x 1.0 - HSS

**€12.91** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 12 x 1.0 - HSS

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut M 10 x 1.5 - LEFT - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. This is a left-hand cutting nut used to make left-hand thread. The hexagon die nut is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 10 x 1.25 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension MF 10 x 1.25. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for MF 10 x 1.25 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread MF 10 x 1.25 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## M10 x 1.25 BaerCoil Bottoming Tap (Helicoil Type)

**€18.09** ~~~~

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 10 x 1.25 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension MF 10 x 1.25. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for MF 10 x 1.25 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread MF 10 x 1.25 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## M10 x 1.5 BaerCoil Bottoming Tap (Helicoil Type)STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

**€18.09** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 10 x 1.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension MF 10 x 1.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for MF 10 x 1.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread MF 10 x 1.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Intermediate (No. 2) M 10 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap intermediate tap (No. 2) allows you to shape a left-hand thread before finishing it with the finishing tap (No. 3). The advantage of pre-cutting a thread with the intermediate tap (No. 2) is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The intermediate tap (No. 2) is marked with two rings and removes approx. 85 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 10 x 1.0 - HSS

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die M 10 x 1.5 - HSS - tolerance 6e

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut M 12 x 1.75 - HSS

* * *

The hexagonal die (also called hexagonal cutting nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This metal-cutting tap has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## M12 x 1.75 Baer Hexagon Die Nut - HSS

**€30.84** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut M 12 x 1.75 - HSS

* * *

The hexagonal die (also called hexagonal cutting nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This metal-cutting tap has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 12 x 1.25 - HSS

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut MF 12 x 1.5 - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## M14 X 1.5 BAER HEX DIE

**€62.31** ~~~~

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut MF 14 x 1.5 - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

* * *

BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and the special die holders also allow you to attach the round die to a tailstock or drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.
