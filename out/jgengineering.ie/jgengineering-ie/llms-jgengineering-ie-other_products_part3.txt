## Description

Plasti-Kote Premium Satin spray paint formula gives an enhanced, consistent coverage in its new can design. The new easy spray technology provides added control to make spray painting easier, faster and cleaner than ever before. Each coat is ultra smooth, providing flawless coverage that dries quickly to a tough, durable finish. The paint can be recoated at anytime for simple, faster project completion. The can's large, comfortable finger pad requires 35% less finger pressure than other spray paint cans, and the twist and lock mechanism means there is no separate top to remove or replace after use. Its cap and button design shields the finger from paint for a cleaner spray-painting process.

Suitable for: wood, metal, plastic, stone, wicker and crafts.

Drying time: touch dry in 30-50 minutes.

Coverage: 2.23m² per tin.

PKT22100 Premium Spray Paint has the following specifications:

Finish: Satin.

Colour: Black.

Pack size: 400ml.

## Description

WD-40 is an all purpose liquid for displacing moisture, corrosion control, lubrication, cleaning and penetration. It has the ability to penetrate the minute grain boundaries on all metals.

Although not essentially a lubricant, WD-40 is regularly used to lubricate all light machinery and electrical equipment. WD-40 protects metal from rust and corrosion, penetrates stuck or jammed parts, displaces moisture, and lubricates just about anything. WD-40 is also great when it comes to cleaning grease, grime, and other marks from most surfaces.

WD-40 is a mixture of chemical concentrates suspended in a high grade petroleum distillate. It will not affect fabrics, rubbers or plastics. Its working temperature is between -100° F and +500° F.

Thoroughly recommended to clean, preserve and protect all tools.

The Five Basic Functions:

CLEANS: WD-40 gets under dirt, marks and grease, making it easy to wipe them away. It also dissolves adhesives, allowing the easy removal of labels, tape, and stickers.

PROTECTS: WD-40 protects metal surfaces with corrosion-resistant ingredients to shield against moisture and other corrosive elements.

LUBRICATES: WD-40's lubricating ingredients are widely dispersed, and hold firmly to all moving parts.

PENETRATES: WD-40 loosens rust-to-metal bonds and frees stuck, frozen or rusted metal parts.

DISPLACES MOISTURE: Because WD-40 displaces moisture, it quickly dries out electrical systems to eliminate moisture-induced short circuits. (Remember to turn the power off before you spray).

Did You Know ?

Discover some unusual uses for WD-40 to keep your world running smoothly!

WD-40 can be used to remove chewing gum from shoes and carpets.

If your favourite 12in has a light scratch, a quick wipe with WD-40 will help stop your record skipping.

Caught with a stuck-fast zip? A squirt of WD-40 will help get you out of a jam.

## WD-40 5 Litre Multi-Use Maintenance Can Plus Spray 5 Litre

**€49.99** ~~~~

WD-40 is an all purpose liquid for displacing moisture, corrosion control, lubrication, cleaning and penetration. It has the ability to penetrate the minute grain boundaries on all metals.

Although not essentially a lubricant, WD-40 is regularly used to lubricate all light machinery and electrical equipment. WD-40 protects metal from rust and corrosion, penetrates stuck or jammed parts, displaces moisture, and lubricates just about anything. WD-40 is also great when it comes to cleaning grease, grime, and other marks from most surfaces.

WD-40 is a mixture of chemical concentrates suspended in a high grade petroleum distillate. It will not affect fabrics, rubbers or plastics. Its working temperature is between -100° F and +500° F.

Thoroughly recommended to clean, preserve and protect all tools.

The Five Basic Functions:

CLEANS: WD-40 gets under dirt, marks and grease, making it easy to wipe them away. It also dissolves adhesives, allowing the easy removal of labels, tape, and stickers.

PROTECTS: WD-40 protects metal surfaces with corrosion-resistant ingredients to shield against moisture and other corrosive elements.

LUBRICATES: WD-40's lubricating ingredients are widely dispersed, and hold firmly to all moving parts.

PENETRATES: WD-40 loosens rust-to-metal bonds and frees stuck, frozen or rusted metal parts.

DISPLACES MOISTURE: Because WD-40 displaces moisture, it quickly dries out electrical systems to eliminate moisture-induced short circuits. (Remember to turn the power off before you spray).
