## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 12 x 1.75 - 12 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

**€49.15** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 5 x 0.8 - 10 mm - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 6 x 1.0 - 14 mm - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 8 x 1.25 - 15 mm - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 10 x 1.5 - 18 mm - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 14 x 2.0 - 24 mm - 50 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

**€130.89** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 16 x 2.0 - 22 mm - 50 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts UNF 1.1/8“ x 12 - 1.5 D (42.86 mm) - free running - 5 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are made of high-quality materials wire thread inserts. BaerCoil® thread inserts provide a durable and powerful threaded connection and scrap recovery in the thread repair. The inserts also create load-bearing connections in materials with low shear strength. thread inserts are precise and wear-resistant, holding your screw firmly in place without changing the thread insert. Ideal for repairing stripped or worn threads. wire thread inserts are commonly used in automotive, electrical, medical, lightweight construction, and aerospace applications.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads and that at the same time nominal diameter. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the manufactured thread is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Particularly in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

The inserts also create load-bearing connections in materials with low shear strength. thread inserts are precise and wear-resistant, holding your screw firmly in place without changing the thread insert. Ideal for repairing stripped or worn threads. wire thread inserts are commonly used in automotive, electrical, medical, lightweight construction, and aerospace applications.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads and that at the same time nominal diameter. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the manufactured thread is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Particularly in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap BSF 1/4 x 26 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension BSF 1/4 x 26. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for BSF 1/4 x 26 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread BSF 1/4 x 26 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Inserting Tool M 10 (and more)

With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way.

For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw.

The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation as this may cause the spigot to break off.

The throw-over tool has a 7 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible.

In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension. This makes it easy to work in deeper areas without having to sacrifice efficiency and precision.

### The hand insertion tool can be used for the following dimensions:

- Metric thread inserts: M 10 x 1.5 & M 10 x 1.25 & M 10 x 1.0 & M 11 x 1.5 & M 11 x 1.25 & M 11 x 1.0
- UNC thread inserts: UNC 7/16 x 14
- UNF thread inserts: UNF 7/16 x 20
- BSW thread inserts: BSW 7/16 x 14
- BSF thread inserts: BSF 7/16 x 18

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Inserting Tool M 3 (and more)

With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way.

For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw.

The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation, as this may cause the spigot to break off.

The throw-over tool has a 5 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible.

In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension. This makes it easy to work in deeper areas without having to sacrifice efficiency and precision.

### The hand insertion tool can be used for the following dimensions:

- Metric thread inserts: M 3 x 0.5 & M 3.5 x 0.6
- UNC thread inserts: UNC 4 x 40 & UNC 5 x 40 & UNC 6 x 32
- UNF thread inserts: UNF 4 x 48 & UNF 6 x 40
- BSW thread inserts: BSW 1/8 x 40
- BA thread inserts: BA 5
