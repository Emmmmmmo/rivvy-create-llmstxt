## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Repair Kit M 5 x 0.8 - ECO

With the BaerFix® thread repair set, damaged M 5 threads can be repaired quickly and easily.

This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm².

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw.

To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts. Use the core drill bit to prepare the core hole and the installation tool to insert the self-tapping thread insert.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Spark Plug Thread Repair Kit M 14 x 1.25

* * *

With the BaerFix® spark plug thread repair set, damaged MF 14 x 1.25 threads can be repaired quickly and easily.

This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm².

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw.

To assist with the repair, in addition to the thread inserts, the set includes a core drill bit, a taper countersink and an assembly tool. Use the core drill bit to prepare the core hole and the installation tool to insert the self-tapping thread insert.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 12 x 1.25

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.
