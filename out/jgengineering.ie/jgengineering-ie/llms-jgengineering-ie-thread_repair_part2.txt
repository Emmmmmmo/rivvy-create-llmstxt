## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 4 x 0.7 - 8 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 5 x 0.8 - 10 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts for spark plugss M 14 x 1.25 - 9 mm - 5 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three cutting holes are self-tapping guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your spark plug thread or glow plug thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection with the spark plug or glow plug is no longer possible. This is where the self-tapping BaerFix® thread insert comes into play. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen the existing thread. If the thread in your cylinder head is damaged, this does not have to be a scrap. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded with higher pull-out strength at the same time and also becomes more wear-resistant. The thread inserts are designed so that the sealing ring of the spark plug protrudes beyond the thread insert.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with tapping holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for light and difficult-to-machine materials. These inserts can take more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three cutting holes are self-tapping guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your spark plug thread or glow plug thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection with the spark plug or glow plug is no longer possible. This is where the self-tapping BaerFix® thread insert comes into play. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen the existing thread. If the thread in your cylinder head is damaged, this does not have to be a scrap. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded with higher pull-out strength at the same time and also becomes more wear-resistant. The thread inserts are designed so that the sealing ring of the spark plug protrudes beyond the thread insert.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with tapping holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for light and difficult-to-machine materials. These inserts can take more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 20 x 2.5 - 27 mm - 5 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## FE20 - M20X2.5 BAERFIX INSERTS - 50Pck

**€79.49** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 20 x 2.5 - 27 mm - 5 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 24 x 3.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 24 x 3.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 24 x 3.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 24 x 3.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap is equipped with a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## M 24 x 3.0 BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

**€96.82** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 24 x 3.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 24 x 3.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 24 x 3.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 24 x 3.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap is equipped with a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 10 x 1.5 - 2.5 D (25 mm) - free running.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

If you have damaged threads, the BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution - while maintaining the same nominal diameter! By reaming and inserting a new EC thread, your old thread becomes strong and stable again. With the BaerCoil® thread insert, your manufactured thread becomes significantly more stable than the original thread!

BaerCoil® thread inserts are sophisticated design elements that ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread. They compensate for pitch and angular errors and thus distribute static and dynamic work loads evenly over all thread turns. This is particularly important in lightweight constructions where the carrier material is to be reduced. BaerCoil® thread inserts make it possible to use smaller and shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in the aerospace and automotive industries.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts for spark plugss M 10 x 1.0 - 13 mm - 5 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three cutting holes are self-tapping guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your spark plug thread or glow plug thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection with the spark plug or glow plug is no longer possible. This is where the self-tapping BaerFix® thread insert comes into play. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen the existing thread. If the thread in your cylinder head is damaged, this does not have to be a scrap. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded with higher pull-out strength at the same time and also becomes more wear-resistant. The thread inserts are designed so that the sealing ring of the spark plug protrudes beyond the thread insert.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with tapping holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for light and difficult-to-machine materials. These inserts can take more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes.

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts for spark plugss M 10 x 1.0 - 13 mm - 5 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three cutting holes are self-tapping guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your spark plug thread or glow plug thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection with the spark plug or glow plug is no longer possible. This is where the self-tapping BaerFix® thread insert comes into play. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen the existing thread. If the thread in your cylinder head is damaged, this does not have to be a scrap. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded with higher pull-out strength at the same time and also becomes more wear-resistant. The thread inserts are designed so that the sealing ring of the spark plug protrudes beyond the thread insert.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with tapping holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for light and difficult-to-machine materials. These inserts can take more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes.
