## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 22 x 1.5

* * *

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 22 x 1.5.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 22.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

normally is stronger than the original one.

Use in machine-building, electrical, automotive,

medical and aerospace industries.

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 22 x 2.5

* * *

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 22 x 2.5.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 22.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 24 x 1.5

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 24 x 1.5.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 24.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 24 x 2.0

* * *

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 24 x 2.0.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 24.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## M24 X 3.0 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 24 x 3.0

* * *

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in M 24 x 3.0.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 24.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 24 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M24 X 3.0 BAER TAP SET 262737401 (P20)

**€75.71** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 24 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M2.5 X 0.45 BAER TAP SET - 262732201 (P19)

**€18.79** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 2.5 x 0.45

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 26 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 27 x 2.0

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 27 x 2.0.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 27.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 27 x 3.0

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 27 x 3.0.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 27.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Thread Repair Workshop Kit M 3 - M 12

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 3 - 12.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair magazine contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand taps with oversize for insert threads, insertion tools, tang breakers and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened if necessary, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## BAER HSSG hand tap- sets (3-piece)  for through-hole and blind hole \| M 3 - M 12 threads

thread cutting with hand tap sets is the proven and traditional method of cutting an ideal internal thread by hand. It is easier for the user to tap straight into the hole, giving better control in the tapping process. The BAER hand taps- sets are 3-piece, manufactured according to DIN 352 and suitable for cutting ISO metric regular threads. A set consists of taper tap (No. 1), intermediate Tap (No. 2) and finishing tap (No. 3). All three share the work of tapping as follows:

- Taper tap (No. 1) (1 ring on shank): Form A, chamfer: 5-6 turns, removes 65% of the thread profile
- Intermediate Tap (No. 2) (2 rings on the shank): Form D, chamfer: 3-4 threads, removes 85% of the thread profile
- Finishing tap (No. 3) (no ring on the shank): Form C, chamfer: 2-3 threads, removes 100% of the thread profile

The BAER hand taps have a square shank, manufactured according to DIN10 and are especially suitable for use in tap wrenches or holding tools. This allows you to tap internal thread by hand without jamming. The reduced force on each individual screw tap is also an advantage, as it reduces the risk of breakage. You use the three-part sets with pilot, centre and finishing tap (No. 3) for coarse thread such as M, BSW, UNC. The BAER hand taps can be used for materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm², such as unalloyed and low-alloy steels and cut a through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D. The advantage of multi-part hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: This makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

### The advantages at a glance:

- lower force effect on each individual screw tap → lower risk of breakage
- better control during the thread-cutting process
- for use in tap wrenches or holding tools
- Use in materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm²
- Through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D

### Technical information:

- Form C: 2 - 3 threads chamfer
- Thread tolerance: ISO2/6H

## BAER HSS round thread cutting die  for M 3 - M 12 external threads

BAER dies are used to produce metric external threads with a round external profile. You want to operate it by hand or by machine? Both work. These BAER dies made of high-performance high-speed steel HSS are suitable for normal applications for various materials with a strength of up to 800 N/mm². These include the following materials: general structural steels, free-cutting steels, case-hardening steels, unalloyed heat-treatable steels, pure copper, low-alloyed copper and copper-tin alloy (bronze) short-chipping, as well as plastics. The symmetrical design allows cutting in both axial directions. There are holes on the outside, here you can fix the die in the die holder and prevent it from twisting during use. All dies have an outer diameter of 25 x 9 mm, so all dies fit into only one die holder. The dies are cylindrical and have three or more cutting edges inside, depending on the size. The spiral point (spiral entry) ensures easy cutting and also good chip removal. The chip holes, which are holes or cavities between the cutting edges, provide the chip transport. They take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. The cutting tool has outer and inner teeth. The flattened outer teeth facilitate the gate, reduce wear and thus increase the tool life time. Each tooth takes a chip of the same width with it when cutting. The inner teeth have no cutting function: in the cut part of the thread they serve as straight guides. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste. You can find suitable cutting paste in our shop. Let the perfect quality of this tool and the strong price-performance ratio convince you. In addition to a fair price, our thread cutting dies for external threads can primarily convince with excellent quality. BAER cutting dies - for perfect external threads.

### The advantages at a glance:

- little space required
- Adjustment without effort
- Use on simple and multi-spindle machines
- simple tool assembly
- Use from both sides
- Outstanding quality at a good price. That is BAER.

### Technical information:

- DIN EN 22568 (formerly DIN 223 B)
- Thread tolerance: ISO-6g
- Chamfer: 1.5

## BAER actuation tools  \#Bear forces - thread cutting in the twinkling of an eye

Tool holders for manual actuation make the use of taps and dies possible in the first place. The adjustable holding tools are made of zinc die casting. They exert enough torque on the screw tap and dies to allow you to cut your threads by hand. BAER tool holders are stable and durable. See for yourself.

### This adjustable tap wrench made of zinc die cast is suitable for the following use:

- Square : 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- for screw tap: M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8

## BAER die stock  25 x 9mm \| M 7-9 \| BSW 5/16 made of zinc die casting

You need a die stock to hold round thread cutting dies. BAER die stocks are manufactured according to DIN 225 and convince by their easy handling. The five fastening screws have a tip that centres in the pilot holes of the cutting irons and thus prevents twisting during use. You can tighten these screws with the enclosed screwdriver, so you always have everything to hand. The die holder is made of zinc die casting and is resilient, wear-resistant and a perfect fit. Benefit from an excellent price-performance ratio. At BAER, you buy tested tools at unbeatable prices with outstanding precision for lasting stability and power absorption!

### This adjustable zinc die casting die holder is suitable for the following use:

- Diameter x height: 25 x 9 mm
- for dies in M and MF: M 7 - M 9
- for dies in: BSW 5/16
- Length: 224 mm

## BAER adjustable tap wrench  GR. 1.1/2 \| M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8 made of zinc die casting

The adjustable tap wrench size 1.1/2 is an operating tool for screw tap from a zinc die casting body, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the clamping jaws, the handles and in the geometry, which make the tool stable and accurately fitting, manufactured according to DIN 1814. The long levers on the right and left help to cut plumb into the hole and easily apply the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. A lever can be twisted off on one side so that work can also be carried out in difficult-to-reach situations.

### This adjustable zinc die casting tap wrench is suitable for the following applications:

- for hand and short machine taps in M and MF: M 1 - M12
- for hand and short machine taps in UNC, UNF, BSW and BSF: 1/16 - 1/2
- for hand and short machine taps in G (BSP): G 1/8
- Square drive: 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- Length: 176 mm

## NOTE:

Please do not extend the handles of the tap wrench under any circumstances. The forces that can be achieved with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

![](https://assets.ebay.baer.tools/BMK312/BAER_ebay_015.jpg)

## BAER thread template  \#Easy determination of thread sizes

With the BAER thread template you can easily determine the thread size. It completes the BAER thread cutting set and you always have everything at hand. The high-quality thread template is suitable for determining the external threads of screws and for determining metric threads. It has thread blades with which all common metric pitches: 0.5 - 1.75 mm can be measured/determined. The thread is determined by the so-called light gap method. You put an appropriate gauge on the thread and hold it against a light source. If almost no light penetrates between the thread and the gauge, the thread size can be read from the corresponding thread sheet. The sizes are stamped on the respective sheets and can be read very well and permanently.

### Technical information:

- 52 blades, for metric and Whitworth threads
- Pitch 0.25-6.00 mm / 62-4 TPI W
- Weight: 83 g
- Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 5.5 cm

![](https://assets.ebay.baer.tools/BMK312/BAER_ebay_015.jpg)

## Quality  for long service life

The high-alloy tool steel HSS can work with up to four times higher cutting speeds than ordinary tool steel.

### This set is characterised by:

- Temperature resistance / heat hardness
- Wear resistance
- Cutting edge stability
- high smooth running
- good chip evacuation

This means that BAER hand taps and dies made of high-speed steel HSS can cope with many material requirements. Accurate work and long-term cost savings are added to this.

## BAER HSSG hand tap- sets (3-piece)  for through-hole and blind hole \| M 3 - M 12 threads

thread cutting with hand tap sets is the proven and traditional method of cutting an ideal internal thread by hand. It is easier for the user to tap straight into the hole, giving better control in the tapping process. The BAER hand taps- sets are 3-piece, manufactured according to DIN 352 and suitable for cutting ISO metric regular threads. A set consists of taper tap (No. 1), intermediate Tap (No. 2) and finishing tap (No. 3). All three share the work of tapping as follows:

- Taper tap (No. 1) (1 ring on shank): Form A, chamfer: 5-6 turns, removes 65% of the thread profile
- Intermediate Tap (No. 2) (2 rings on the shank): Form D, chamfer: 3-4 threads, removes 85% of the thread profile
- Finishing tap (No. 3) (no ring on the shank): Form C, chamfer: 2-3 threads, removes 100% of the thread profile

The BAER hand taps have a square shank, manufactured according to DIN10 and are especially suitable for use in tap wrenches or holding tools. This allows you to tap internal thread by hand without jamming. The reduced force on each individual screw tap is also an advantage, as it reduces the risk of breakage. You use the three-part sets with pilot, centre and finishing tap (No. 3) for coarse thread such as M, BSW, UNC. The BAER hand taps can be used for materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm², such as unalloyed and low-alloy steels and cut a through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D. The advantage of multi-part hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: This makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

### The advantages at a glance:

- lower force effect on each individual screw tap → lower risk of breakage
- better control during the thread-cutting process
- for use in tap wrenches or holding tools
- Use in materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm²
- Through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D

### Technical information:

- Form C: 2 - 3 threads chamfer
- Thread tolerance: ISO2/6H

## BAER HSS round thread cutting die  for M 3 - M 12 external threads

BAER dies are used to produce metric external threads with a round external profile. You want to operate it by hand or by machine? Both work. These BAER dies made of high-performance high-speed steel HSS are suitable for normal applications for various materials with a strength of up to 800 N/mm². These include the following materials: general structural steels, free-cutting steels, case-hardening steels, unalloyed heat-treatable steels, pure copper, low-alloyed copper and copper-tin alloy (bronze) short-chipping, as well as plastics. The symmetrical design allows cutting in both axial directions. There are holes on the outside, here you can fix the die in the die holder and prevent it from twisting during use. All dies have an outer diameter of 25 x 9 mm, so all dies fit into only one die holder. The dies are cylindrical and have three or more cutting edges inside, depending on the size. The spiral point (spiral entry) ensures easy cutting and also good chip removal. The chip holes, which are holes or cavities between the cutting edges, provide the chip transport. They take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. The cutting tool has outer and inner teeth. The flattened outer teeth facilitate the gate, reduce wear and thus increase the tool life time. Each tooth takes a chip of the same width with it when cutting. The inner teeth have no cutting function: in the cut part of the thread they serve as straight guides. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste. You can find suitable cutting paste in our shop. Let the perfect quality of this tool and the strong price-performance ratio convince you. In addition to a fair price, our thread cutting dies for external threads can primarily convince with excellent quality. BAER cutting dies - for perfect external threads.

### The advantages at a glance:

- little space required
- Adjustment without effort
- Use on simple and multi-spindle machines
- simple tool assembly
- Use from both sides
- Outstanding quality at a good price. That is BAER.

### Technical information:

- DIN EN 22568 (formerly DIN 223 B)
- Thread tolerance: ISO-6g
- Chamfer: 1.5

## BAER actuation tools  \#Bear forces - thread cutting in the twinkling of an eye

Tool holders for manual actuation make the use of taps and dies possible in the first place. The adjustable holding tools are made of zinc die casting. They exert enough torque on the screw tap and dies to allow you to cut your threads by hand. BAER tool holders are stable and durable. See for yourself.

### This adjustable tap wrench made of zinc die cast is suitable for the following use:

- Square : 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- for screw tap: M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8

## BAER die stock  25 x 9mm \| M 7-9 \| BSW 5/16 made of zinc die casting

You need a die stock to hold round thread cutting dies. BAER die stocks are manufactured according to DIN 225 and convince by their easy handling. The five fastening screws have a tip that centres in the pilot holes of the cutting irons and thus prevents twisting during use. You can tighten these screws with the enclosed screwdriver, so you always have everything to hand. The die holder is made of zinc die casting and is resilient, wear-resistant and a perfect fit. Benefit from an excellent price-performance ratio. At BAER, you buy tested tools at unbeatable prices with outstanding precision for lasting stability and power absorption!

### This adjustable zinc die casting die holder is suitable for the following use:

- Diameter x height: 25 x 9 mm
- for dies in M and MF: M 7 - M 9
- for dies in: BSW 5/16
- Length: 224 mm

## BAER adjustable tap wrench  GR. 1.1/2 \| M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8 made of zinc die casting

The adjustable tap wrench size 1.1/2 is an operating tool for screw tap from a zinc die casting body, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the clamping jaws, the handles and in the geometry, which make the tool stable and accurately fitting, manufactured according to DIN 1814. The long levers on the right and left help to cut plumb into the hole and easily apply the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. A lever can be twisted off on one side so that work can also be carried out in difficult-to-reach situations.

### This adjustable zinc die casting tap wrench is suitable for the following applications:

- for hand and short machine taps in M and MF: M 1 - M12
- for hand and short machine taps in UNC, UNF, BSW and BSF: 1/16 - 1/2
- for hand and short machine taps in G (BSP): G 1/8
- Square drive: 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- Length: 176 mm

## NOTE:

Please do not extend the handles of the tap wrench under any circumstances. The forces that can be achieved with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

## BAER thread template  \#Easy determination of thread sizes

With the BAER thread template you can easily determine the thread size. It completes the BAER thread cutting set and you always have everything at hand. The high-quality thread template is suitable for determining the external threads of screws and for determining metric threads. It has thread blades with which all common metric pitches: 0.5 - 1.75 mm can be measured/determined. The thread is determined by the so-called light gap method. You put an appropriate gauge on the thread and hold it against a light source. If almost no light penetrates between the thread and the gauge, the thread size can be read from the corresponding thread sheet. The sizes are stamped on the respective sheets and can be read very well and permanently.

### Technical information:

- 52 blades, for metric and Whitworth threads
- Pitch 0.25-6.00 mm / 62-4 TPI W
- Weight: 83 g
- Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 5.5 cm
