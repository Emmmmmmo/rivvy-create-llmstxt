BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\n\n### Dimensions\n\n| Height H | 25 mm |\n| Diameter | 1\" |\n| Pitch | 11 |\n| Dimension | R (BSPT) 1\" x 11 |\n\n### Characteristics\n\n| Product group | Round cutting die |\n| Product type | Hexagon die nuts |\n| Thread standard | R (BSPT): Tapered Whitworth pipe thread according to ISO 7/1 DIN EN 10226-1 + 2 |\n| Tolerance | medium |\n| Direction | Right |\n| Standard | DIN 382 |\n| Material | HSS |\n\n### Technical information - Cutting dies\n\n![Bild Anschnitt: https://media.baer.tools/media/vector/75/83/18/schneideisen_anschnitt.svg](https://media.baer.tools/media/vector/75/83/18/schneideisen_anschnitt.svg)\n\n**Chamfer**\n\n1,5\n\n![Bild Material: https://media.baer.tools/media/vector/c8/8d/2f/gewindebohrer_blank.svg](https://media.baer.tools/media/vector/c8/8d/2f/gewindebohrer_blank.svg)\n\n**Material**\n\nHSS\n\n![Tolerance: medium](https://media.baer.tools/media/vector/a5/fd/29/toleranz.svg)\n\n**Tolerance**\n\nmedium\n\n### Applications\n\n- for recutting and repairing damaged threads\n- good machinable materials up to 800 N/mm²\n- in places that are difficult to access\n\n### Technical drawing\n\n![](https://media.baer.tools/media/vector/f6/6f/f9/Technische_Zeichnung_Schneidmutter_konische_Gewinde.svg)\n\n| Height H | 25 mm |\n| Wrench size S | 60 mm |\n| Dimension Diameter D | R (BSPT) 1\" x 11 |\n| Diameter | 1\" |\n\n### Payment & Security\n\nPayment methods\n\n- American Express\n- Apple Pay\n- Bancontact\n- Google Pay\n- iDEAL\n- Maestro\n- Mastercard\n- Shop Pay\n- Union Pay\n- Visa\n\nYour payment information is processed securely.

It is essentially made up of two components: the body and the handles. They are sturdily constructed and therefore very resilient and fit precisely.\n\nThe core of the tool is the body. It is provided with a round opening into which the round die is inserted. With the help of five fastening screws, which can be tightened with a flat-blade screwdriver, the round die is fixed in the die holder. The screws engage in the holes of the cutting die and hold it in place in this way in the die holder. The round die is then firmly fixed in place and can be removed. This gives it a tight fit and prevents it from turning when the thread is cut.\n\nThere are two handles on the left and right of the body. They allow comfortable handling and optimum distribution of the force. This makes it easy to cut external threads manually without using a machine.\n\nThe use of die guides is also possible due to the design. When using die guides, make sure that the holes of the guide overlap with the holes of the die so that the chip transport is guaranteed.\n\nOnce you have got the hang of it, cutting precise external threads by hand quickly becomes child's play.\n\n### The perfect thread in just a few steps:\n\n1. Before starting work, the bolt must be prepared. Clamp the bolt in a vice and chamfer the end. This means filing the edges all around at an angle of 45 degrees. This not only makes it easier to insert the cutting tool into the die holder, but also to screw it into the receiving internal thread later.\n2. When the bolt is ready for use, the next step is to prepare the die holder. If the die is suitable for use with a die guide, then you can fit the die guide at this point. The guide will help you to cut the thread vertically. Then insert the die into the die holder and secure it against rotation with the retaining screws.\n3. Cutting is made easier by using cutting oil or cutting paste. Apply a drop to the bolt and/or the thread cutting die in the die holder.\n4. Now place the die holder on the bolt and turn it until the desired thread length is reached. Then unscrew the die holder in the opposite direction.\n\n### Dimensions\n\n| Height H | 9,5 mm |\n| Diameter | 25,4 mm |\n| Dimension | 1\" x 3/8 |\n| Length | 224 mm |\n\n### Characteristics\n\n| Product group | Operating tools |\n| Product type | Die Holders |\n| Material | Die casting |\n\n### Technical drawing\n\n![](https://assets.baer.tools/media/14/7a/7c/1687371505/Zeichnung_Schneideisenhalter.svg)\n\n| Height H | 9,5 mm |\n| Diameter | 25,4 mm |\n| Length | 224 mm |\n\n### Payment & Security\n\nPayment methods\n\n- American Express\n- Apple Pay\n- Bancontact\n- Google Pay\n- iDEAL\n- Maestro\n- Mastercard\n- Shop Pay\n- Union Pay\n- Visa\n\nYour payment information is processed securely.
