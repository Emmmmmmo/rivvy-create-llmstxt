## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 3 x 0.5 - 4 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 10 x 1.5 - 18 mm - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 3 x 0.5 - 6 mm - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 6 x 1.0 - 14 mm - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

[Instruction for use (Thread Repair)](http://www.baercoil.com/en/instructions_baerfix.html)

With BaerFix the new thread is stronger than the original one.

When used in light alloys, for example, a degree of pull-out strength is achieved which far exceeds the yield strength of a screw 8.8.

_Important:_ Suitable for following materials: Aluminium, light alloys, NF metals,

brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminated plastic and hardwood.

For strong, hard and tough materials it is recommended to tap the thread (max. intermediate tap)

## Description

Faithfull spray adhesive is simple to use either inside or outside. When used inside, allow adequate ventilation during use and afterwards to remove all fumes.

Spray adhesive replaces ordinary double sided tapes and can be used for a wide range of applications such as floor laying, upholstery and mounting photographs.

Spray adhesive fixes almost all surfaces (excluding Vinyl). Make sure the surfaces you are joining are porous.

Each 500ml can covers an area of 60 sq ft approximately (medium setting).

Features include:

IMPACT STRENGTH - unique rubber particles increase impact-resistance and strength to handle everyday use after your repair or creation is set.

WON'T CLOG - anti-clog tip with metal pin keeps nozzle clean.

EASY TO USE - thick formula flows better for improved control. Dries in just 30-60 seconds, with no clamping.

WHATEVER THE SURFACE - use on nearly anything, from wood, metal, ceramics, some plastics, rubber and a whole lot more!

## Description

Plasti-Kote Premium Satin spray paint formula gives an enhanced, consistent coverage in its new can design. The new easy spray technology provides added control to make spray painting easier, faster and cleaner than ever before. Each coat is ultra smooth, providing flawless coverage that dries quickly to a tough, durable finish. The paint can be recoated at anytime for simple, faster project completion. The can's large, comfortable finger pad requires 35% less finger pressure than other spray paint cans, and the twist and lock mechanism means there is no separate top to remove or replace after use. Its cap and button design shields the finger from paint for a cleaner spray-painting process.

Suitable for: wood, metal, plastic, stone, wicker and crafts.

Coverage: 2.23m² per tin.

## Twist & Spray Satin Black 400ml

**€12.99** ~~~~

Plasti-Kote Premium Satin spray paint formula gives an enhanced, consistent coverage in its new can design. The new easy spray technology provides added control to make spray painting easier, faster and cleaner than ever before. Each coat is ultra smooth, providing flawless coverage that dries quickly to a tough, durable finish. The paint can be recoated at anytime for simple, faster project completion. The can's large, comfortable finger pad requires 35% less finger pressure than other spray paint cans, and the twist and lock mechanism means there is no separate top to remove or replace after use. Its cap and button design shields the finger from paint for a cleaner spray-painting process.

Suitable for: wood, metal, plastic, stone, wicker and crafts.

Drying time: touch dry in 30-50 minutes.

Coverage: 2.23m² per tin.

* * *

PKT22100 Premium Spray Paint has the following specifications:

Finish: Satin.

Colour: Black.

Pack size: 400ml.

## Description

WD-40 is an all purpose liquid for displacing moisture, corrosion control, lubrication, cleaning and penetration. It has the ability to penetrate the minute grain boundaries on all metals.

Although not essentially a lubricant, WD-40 is regularly used to lubricate all light machinery and electrical equipment. WD-40 protects metal from rust and corrosion, penetrates stuck or jammed parts, displaces moisture, and lubricates just about anything. WD-40 is also great when it comes to cleaning grease, grime, and other marks from most surfaces.

WD-40 is a mixture of chemical concentrates suspended in a high grade petroleum distillate. It will not affect fabrics, rubbers or plastics. Its working temperature is between -100° F and +500° F.

Thoroughly recommended to clean, preserve and protect all tools.

The Five Basic Functions:

CLEANS: WD-40 gets under dirt, marks and grease, making it easy to wipe them away. It also dissolves adhesives, allowing the easy removal of labels, tape, and stickers.

PROTECTS: WD-40 protects metal surfaces with corrosion-resistant ingredients to shield against moisture and other corrosive elements.

LUBRICATES: WD-40's lubricating ingredients are widely dispersed, and hold firmly to all moving parts.

PENETRATES: WD-40 loosens rust-to-metal bonds and frees stuck, frozen or rusted metal parts.

DISPLACES MOISTURE: Because WD-40 displaces moisture, it quickly dries out electrical systems to eliminate moisture-induced short circuits. (Remember to turn the power off before you spray).

Did You Know ?

Discover some unusual uses for WD-40 to keep your world running smoothly!

Spray WD-40 onto a clean cloth and wipe to remove scuff marks off skirting boards.

Rid shower screens of water marks and smears with a rub down with WD-40.

Give piano keys a clean up with a squirt of WD-40 and a clean cloth.

Slugs attacking your favourite plant? Spraying WD-40 on your plant pots will keep them at bay.

Stop your ironing board squeaking with a squirt of WD-40 on moving hinges and parts.

Tea stains on work tops or lino flooring are no match for WD-40: apply a squirt of oil to a clean cloth and wipe them away.

Squirrels pinching your nuts? A squirt of WD-40 on your bird table stand will help stop them stealing food left out for feathered friends.

WD-40 can be used to remove chewing gum from shoes and carpets.

If your favourite 12in has a light scratch, a quick wipe with WD-40 will help stop your record skipping.

Caught with a stuck-fast zip? A squirt of WD-40 will help get you out of a jam.
