## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 12 x 1.75 - 22 mm - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

### Attributes

- Thread repair damaged or worn threads
- Scrap recovery
- Thread armoring of materials with low shear strength such as aluminium and magnesium alloys, wood, PVC, etc
- For example, in an application in light metal, a pull-out strength can be achieved that is higher than the yield strength of an 8.8 screw.
- Cutting the holding thread itself during screwing in
- high compression with the holding material
- very high pull-out strength
- minimises space and weight
- high corrosion resistance
- easy to use
- Areas of application in the entire metal and plastics processing industry

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 12 x 1.75 - 22 mm - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

### Attributes

- Thread repair damaged or worn threads
- Scrap recovery
- Thread armoring of materials with low shear strength such as aluminium and magnesium alloys, wood, PVC, etc
- For example, in an application in light metal, a pull-out strength can be achieved that is higher than the yield strength of an 8.8 screw.
- Cutting the holding thread itself during screwing in
- high compression with the holding material
- very high pull-out strength
- minimises space and weight
- high corrosion resistance
- easy to use
- Areas of application in the entire metal and plastics processing industry
