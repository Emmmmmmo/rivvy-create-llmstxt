!\[Illustration of BaerCoil thread insert in use – before and after thread repair\]

* * *

## Why Choose BaerCoil® Thread Inserts?

[**BaerCoil® wire thread inserts**](https://www.jgengineering.ie/collections/helicoil-inserts-ireland "Shop Inserts ") are designed to make your connections stronger and more durable – even in metals with **low shear strength**. They create load-bearing connections that are:

- **Precise and wear-resistant**

- **Capable of withstanding high thermal loads**

- **Trusted in aerospace, automotive, mechanical engineering, and even military applications**


That’s why leading industries worldwide rely on BaerCoil®.

* * *

## Thread Broken? Repair It with BaerCoil®

A stripped or worn thread doesn’t mean scrapping your part. With a [**BaerCoil® thread repair kit**](https://www.jgengineering.ie/collections/baercoil-thread-repair-kits-helicoil "Shop Kits") from **JG Engineering Supplies**, you can:

1. Cut a slightly larger holding thread.

2. Screw in the BaerCoil® insert.

3. Re-fit your original fastener.


The result? A **stronger, more wear-resistant connection** than the original.

!\[Photo of BaerCoil thread repair kit with tools and inserts\]

* * *

## Balanced Load Distribution

Another advantage of **BaerCoil® inserts** is how they distribute both static and dynamic loads evenly across thread turns. Their flexibility also compensates for pitch and angular errors, ensuring **optimum force transmission** from bolt to nut.

This makes them ideal for **lightweight constructions** where reducing carrier material and using smaller bolted joints is essential. That’s why **aerospace and automotive industries** rely on BaerCoil® to save material, reduce weight, and conserve resources.

* * *

## Why Buy from JG Engineering Supplies?

- **Every Size, Every Kit in Stock** – no waiting, no backorders.

- **Live Inventory** on [www.jgengineering.ie](https://www.jgengineering.ie/) – order with confidence.
