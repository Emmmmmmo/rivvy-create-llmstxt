## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts UNF No. 10 x 32 - 1.0 D (4.83 mm) 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. The inserts also create load-bearing connections in materials with low shear strength. thread inserts are precise and wear-resistant, holding your screw firmly in place without changing the thread insert. Ideal for repairing stripped or worn threads. wire thread inserts are often used in automotive, electrical, medical, lightweight construction, and aerospace applications.

For thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) for the wire thread insert is cut. Often this thread is also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert).

BaerCoil® thread inserts are perfect for applications where a balanced distribution of forces is required. They can withstand both static and dynamic loads and help save support material.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened with a side cutter or similar, according to the required length.
