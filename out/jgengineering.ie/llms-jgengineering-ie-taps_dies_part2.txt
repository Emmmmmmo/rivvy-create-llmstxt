## Description

## BAER Round Cutting Die G (BSP) 3/4 x 14 - HSS

* * *

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form C - NPT 3/4 x 14

* * *

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap UNC 3/8 x 16 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of the dimension UNC 3/8 x 16. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for UNC 3/8 x 16 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread UNC 3/8 x 16 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut UNC 3/8 x 16 - HSS

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

## BAER Die Stocks - PRO 55 x 16mm \| MF 22-26 \| G (BSP) 5/8-3/4

* * *

Our PRO die holder are made of high-end zinc die casting. The die holder is a very special holding or operating tool designed to hold a thread cutting die and operate it by hand. It is essentially made up of two components: the body and the handles. They are very sturdily constructed and are therefore highly resilient, wear-resistant and a perfect fit.

The core of the tool is the body. It is provided with a round opening into which the round die is inserted. With the help of five fastening screws, which can be tightened with a slotted screwdriver, the round die is fixed in the die holder. The screws engage in the holes of the cutting die and hold it in place in this way in the die holder. The round die is then firmly fixed in place and can be removed. This gives it a tight fit and prevents it from turning when the thread is cut.

There are two handles on the left and right of the body. They allow comfortable handling and optimum distribution of the force. This makes it easy to cut external threads manually without using a machine.

The use of die guides is also possible due to the design. When using die guides, make sure that the holes of the guide overlap with the holes of the die so that the chip transport is guaranteed.

Once you have got the hang of it, cutting precise external threads by hand quickly becomes child's play.

### The perfect thread in just a few steps:

1. Before starting work, the bolt must be prepared. Clamp the bolt in a vice and chamfer the end. This means filing the edges all around at an angle of 45 degrees. This not only makes it easier to insert the cutting tool into the die holder, but also to screw it into the receiving internal thread later.
2. When the bolt is ready for use, the next step is to prepare the die holder. If the die is suitable for use with a die guide, then you can fit the die guide at this point. The guide will help you to cut the thread vertically. Then insert the die into the die holder and secure it against rotation with the retaining screws.
3. Cutting is made easier by using cutting oil or cutting paste. Apply a drop to the bolt and/or the thread cutting die in the die holder.
4. Now place the die holder on the bolt and turn it until the desired thread length is reached. Then unscrew the die holder in the opposite direction.

### The most important things at a glance:

- BAERENSTARK - Our PRO holding tools convince with resilience and durability and are made of high-quality zinc die casting-body.
- EXCELLENT QUALITY - At BAER you buy tested tools at a bear-strong price with outstanding precision for durable stability and force absorption!
- EASY TO USE - The die holder impresses with easy handling and good weight distribution.

## Description

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 3/4 x 14 - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 3/4 x 14 - HSS

**€64.09** ~~~~

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 3/4 x 14 - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut M 10 x 1.5 - HSS

The hexagonal die (also called hexagon die nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut UNC 1/2 x 13 - HSS

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSE Machine Tap - 35° RSP - MF 20 x 1.5 - DIN 374

Our machine taps are powerful and reliable taps for efficient machining in one step with the machine. Machine taps are used especially in industrial manufacturing. They can be used in CNC machines, thread cutting machines, cordless drills and pneumatic tapping arms, among others. As they are characterised by high efficiency and low production costs, they are often used in series production. The thread is cut by machine in one operation. Thus, although the BAER machine tap can basically be compared with short machine taps, it is designed for use with the machine.

The machine tap can be used for blind holes, as the short chamfer and the spiral flutes ensure that the chip is discharged to the rear of the hole.

Every material shows individual chip behaviour. Therefore, screw taps must have the correct rake angle and - for even better results - a specially treated surface. This is the only way to achieve a good chip transport and to produce a thread that is true to gauge.

The high quality of the cobalt-alloyed HSSE steel we use ensures that our tools are extremely durable and robust. Due to special hardening processes and repeated tempering the hardness structure is very homogeneous, which forms the ideal basis for a genuine BAER screw taps. This increases the toughness and stability of the screw taps, allowing them to remain in use for longer.

## BAER HSSE Machine Tap - 35° RSP - MF 20 x 1.5 - DIN 374

**€39.49** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSE Machine Tap - 35° RSP - MF 20 x 1.5 - DIN 374

Our machine taps are powerful and reliable taps for efficient machining in one step with the machine. Machine taps are used especially in industrial manufacturing. They can be used in CNC machines, thread cutting machines, cordless drills and pneumatic tapping arms, among others. As they are characterised by high efficiency and low production costs, they are often used in series production. The thread is cut by machine in one operation. Thus, although the BAER machine tap can basically be compared with short machine taps, it is designed for use with the machine.

The machine tap can be used for blind holes, as the short chamfer and the spiral flutes ensure that the chip is discharged to the rear of the hole.

Every material shows individual chip behaviour. Therefore, screw taps must have the correct rake angle and - for even better results - a specially treated surface. This is the only way to achieve a good chip transport and to produce a thread that is true to gauge.

The high quality of the cobalt-alloyed HSSE steel we use ensures that our tools are extremely durable and robust. Due to special hardening processes and repeated tempering the hardness structure is very homogeneous, which forms the ideal basis for a genuine BAER screw taps. This increases the toughness and stability of the screw taps, allowing them to remain in use for longer.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20

**€18.45** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 9 x 18

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die BSW 1/2 x 12 - HSS

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or drill press. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 12 x 0.5 - HSS

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. Round dies are cylindrical and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to secure the die in matching die stock and holders using retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 12 x 1.0 - HSS

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.
