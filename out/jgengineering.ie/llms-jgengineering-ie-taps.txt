## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut R (BSPT) 1" x 11 - HSS

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF 17 x 1.0

* * *

The hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

## M17 x 1 BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF

**$35.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF 17 x 1.0

* * *

The hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Intermediate (No. 2) M 10 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap intermediate tap (No. 2) allows you to shape a left-hand thread before finishing it with the finishing tap (No. 3). The advantage of pre-cutting a thread with the intermediate tap (No. 2) is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The intermediate tap (No. 2) is marked with two rings and removes approx. 85 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## M10 x 1.5 BAER HSSG Hand Tap Intermediate (No. 2) - LEFT

**$24.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Intermediate (No. 2) M 10 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap intermediate tap (No. 2) allows you to shape a left-hand thread before finishing it with the finishing tap (No. 3). The advantage of pre-cutting a thread with the intermediate tap (No. 2) is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The intermediate tap (No. 2) is marked with two rings and removes approx. 85 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## Description

PRODUCT INFORMATION

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 36 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M18 X 1.5 Baer® Tap Set (262637202)

**$47.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 18 x 1.5

- Doppelte Power für perfekte Gewinde – Jeder Gewindebohrer übernimmt seinen Part für das perfekte Ergebnis!
- Zweiteiliger Handgewindebohrer-Satz aus geschliffenem HSS-Stahl
- Form C mit geraden Nuten für Löcher, die durch das Werkstück durch gehen (Durchgangslöcher), oder solche, die im Werkstück enden (Sacklöcher), mit einer Gewindetiefe bis zu 2 x Durchmesser
- Geeignet für die Bearbeitung von gut zerspanbaren Materialien wie unlegierte und niedriglegierte Stähle bis 900 N/mm².
- Schaft mit reduziertem Durchmesser – Schaftdurchmesser ist kleiner als das Gewinde für präzises Arbeiten

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) G (BSP) 1.1/2 x 11

**$296.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) G (BSP) 1.1/2 x 11

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## 1/4" X 26 BSF HAND TAP SET - 220301002 (P118)

**$17.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) BSF 1/4 x 26

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 9 x 18

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 32 x 1.5

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 20 x 1.5

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 20 x 2.5

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 24 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M24 X 3.0 BAER TAP SET 262737401 (P20)

**$91.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 24 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M22 X 1.0 BAER TAP 120301070

**$76.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.0

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## MF M22 X 1.5 BAER TAP (120301072)

**$80.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.5

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M22 X 1.5 LEFT HAND TAP SET

**$123.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.5 - LEFT

The left-hand tapping hand tap set consists of two taps and enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. One left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than at coarse thread, as the thread profile area is smaller than for coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M30 x 3.5 BAER TAP SET

**$169.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 30 x 3.5

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M14 x 1.25 Baer Tap Set (P44) (262635402)

**$37.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 14 x 1.25

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M14 x 1.5 Baer Tap set (Page 45)

**$32.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 14 x 1.5

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 2.5 x 0.45

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## BAER HSSG hand tap- sets (3-piece)  for through-hole and blind hole \| M 3 - M 12 threads

thread cutting with hand tap sets is the proven and traditional method of cutting an ideal internal thread by hand. It is easier for the user to tap straight into the hole, giving better control in the tapping process. The BAER hand taps- sets are 3-piece, manufactured according to DIN 352 and suitable for cutting ISO metric regular threads. A set consists of taper tap (No. 1), intermediate Tap (No. 2) and finishing tap (No. 3). All three share the work of tapping as follows:

- Taper tap (No. 1) (1 ring on shank): Form A, chamfer: 5-6 turns, removes 65% of the thread profile
- Intermediate Tap (No. 2) (2 rings on the shank): Form D, chamfer: 3-4 threads, removes 85% of the thread profile
- Finishing tap (No. 3) (no ring on the shank): Form C, chamfer: 2-3 threads, removes 100% of the thread profile

The BAER hand taps have a square shank, manufactured according to DIN10 and are especially suitable for use in tap wrenches or holding tools. This allows you to tap internal thread by hand without jamming. The reduced force on each individual screw tap is also an advantage, as it reduces the risk of breakage. You use the three-part sets with pilot, centre and finishing tap (No. 3) for coarse thread such as M, BSW, UNC. The BAER hand taps can be used for materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm², such as unalloyed and low-alloy steels and cut a through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D. The advantage of multi-part hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: This makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

### The advantages at a glance:

- lower force effect on each individual screw tap → lower risk of breakage
- better control during the thread-cutting process
- for use in tap wrenches or holding tools
- Use in materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm²
- Through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D

### Technical information:

- Form C: 2 - 3 threads chamfer
- Thread tolerance: ISO2/6H

## BAER HSS round thread cutting die  for M 3 - M 12 external threads

BAER dies are used to produce metric external threads with a round external profile. You want to operate it by hand or by machine? Both work. These BAER dies made of high-performance high-speed steel HSS are suitable for normal applications for various materials with a strength of up to 800 N/mm². These include the following materials: general structural steels, free-cutting steels, case-hardening steels, unalloyed heat-treatable steels, pure copper, low-alloyed copper and copper-tin alloy (bronze) short-chipping, as well as plastics. The symmetrical design allows cutting in both axial directions. There are holes on the outside, here you can fix the die in the die holder and prevent it from twisting during use. All dies have an outer diameter of 25 x 9 mm, so all dies fit into only one die holder. The dies are cylindrical and have three or more cutting edges inside, depending on the size. The spiral point (spiral entry) ensures easy cutting and also good chip removal. The chip holes, which are holes or cavities between the cutting edges, provide the chip transport. They take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. The cutting tool has outer and inner teeth. The flattened outer teeth facilitate the gate, reduce wear and thus increase the tool life time. Each tooth takes a chip of the same width with it when cutting. The inner teeth have no cutting function: in the cut part of the thread they serve as straight guides. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste. You can find suitable cutting paste in our shop. Let the perfect quality of this tool and the strong price-performance ratio convince you. In addition to a fair price, our thread cutting dies for external threads can primarily convince with excellent quality. BAER cutting dies - for perfect external threads.

### The advantages at a glance:

- little space required
- Adjustment without effort
- Use on simple and multi-spindle machines
- simple tool assembly
- Use from both sides
- Outstanding quality at a good price. That is BAER.

### Technical information:

- DIN EN 22568 (formerly DIN 223 B)
- Thread tolerance: ISO-6g
- Chamfer: 1.5

## BAER actuation tools  \#Bear forces - thread cutting in the twinkling of an eye

Tool holders for manual actuation make the use of taps and dies possible in the first place. The adjustable holding tools are made of zinc die casting. They exert enough torque on the screw tap and dies to allow you to cut your threads by hand. BAER tool holders are stable and durable. See for yourself.

### This adjustable tap wrench made of zinc die cast is suitable for the following use:

- Square : 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- for screw tap: M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8

## BAER die stock  25 x 9mm \| M 7-9 \| BSW 5/16 made of zinc die casting

You need a die stock to hold round thread cutting dies. BAER die stocks are manufactured according to DIN 225 and convince by their easy handling. The five fastening screws have a tip that centres in the pilot holes of the cutting irons and thus prevents twisting during use. You can tighten these screws with the enclosed screwdriver, so you always have everything to hand. The die holder is made of zinc die casting and is resilient, wear-resistant and a perfect fit. Benefit from an excellent price-performance ratio. At BAER, you buy tested tools at unbeatable prices with outstanding precision for lasting stability and power absorption!

### This adjustable zinc die casting die holder is suitable for the following use:

- Diameter x height: 25 x 9 mm
- for dies in M and MF: M 7 - M 9
- for dies in: BSW 5/16
- Length: 224 mm

## BAER adjustable tap wrench  GR. 1.1/2 \| M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8 made of zinc die casting

The adjustable tap wrench size 1.1/2 is an operating tool for screw tap from a zinc die casting body, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the clamping jaws, the handles and in the geometry, which make the tool stable and accurately fitting, manufactured according to DIN 1814. The long levers on the right and left help to cut plumb into the hole and easily apply the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. A lever can be twisted off on one side so that work can also be carried out in difficult-to-reach situations.

### This adjustable zinc die casting tap wrench is suitable for the following applications:

- for hand and short machine taps in M and MF: M 1 - M12
- for hand and short machine taps in UNC, UNF, BSW and BSF: 1/16 - 1/2
- for hand and short machine taps in G (BSP): G 1/8
- Square drive: 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- Length: 176 mm

## NOTE:

Please do not extend the handles of the tap wrench under any circumstances. The forces that can be achieved with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

![](https://assets.ebay.baer.tools/BMK312/BAER_ebay_015.jpg)

## BAER thread template  \#Easy determination of thread sizes

With the BAER thread template you can easily determine the thread size. It completes the BAER thread cutting set and you always have everything at hand. The high-quality thread template is suitable for determining the external threads of screws and for determining metric threads. It has thread blades with which all common metric pitches: 0.5 - 1.75 mm can be measured/determined. The thread is determined by the so-called light gap method. You put an appropriate gauge on the thread and hold it against a light source. If almost no light penetrates between the thread and the gauge, the thread size can be read from the corresponding thread sheet. The sizes are stamped on the respective sheets and can be read very well and permanently.

### Technical information:

- 52 blades, for metric and Whitworth threads
- Pitch 0.25-6.00 mm / 62-4 TPI W
- Weight: 83 g
- Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 5.5 cm

![](https://assets.ebay.baer.tools/BMK312/BAER_ebay_015.jpg)

## Quality  for long service life

The high-alloy tool steel HSS can work with up to four times higher cutting speeds than ordinary tool steel.

### This set is characterised by:

- Temperature resistance / heat hardness
- Wear resistance
- Cutting edge stability
- high smooth running
- good chip evacuation

This means that BAER hand taps and dies made of high-speed steel HSS can cope with many material requirements. Accurate work and long-term cost savings are added to this.

## BAER HSSG hand tap- sets (3-piece)  for through-hole and blind hole \| M 3 - M 12 threads

thread cutting with hand tap sets is the proven and traditional method of cutting an ideal internal thread by hand. It is easier for the user to tap straight into the hole, giving better control in the tapping process. The BAER hand taps- sets are 3-piece, manufactured according to DIN 352 and suitable for cutting ISO metric regular threads. A set consists of taper tap (No. 1), intermediate Tap (No. 2) and finishing tap (No. 3). All three share the work of tapping as follows:

- Taper tap (No. 1) (1 ring on shank): Form A, chamfer: 5-6 turns, removes 65% of the thread profile
- Intermediate Tap (No. 2) (2 rings on the shank): Form D, chamfer: 3-4 threads, removes 85% of the thread profile
- Finishing tap (No. 3) (no ring on the shank): Form C, chamfer: 2-3 threads, removes 100% of the thread profile

The BAER hand taps have a square shank, manufactured according to DIN10 and are especially suitable for use in tap wrenches or holding tools. This allows you to tap internal thread by hand without jamming. The reduced force on each individual screw tap is also an advantage, as it reduces the risk of breakage. You use the three-part sets with pilot, centre and finishing tap (No. 3) for coarse thread such as M, BSW, UNC. The BAER hand taps can be used for materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm², such as unalloyed and low-alloy steels and cut a through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D. The advantage of multi-part hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: This makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

### The advantages at a glance:

- lower force effect on each individual screw tap → lower risk of breakage
- better control during the thread-cutting process
- for use in tap wrenches or holding tools
- Use in materials with good machinability up to 900 N/mm²
- Through-hole and blind hole up to 2 x D

### Technical information:

- Form C: 2 - 3 threads chamfer
- Thread tolerance: ISO2/6H

## BAER HSS round thread cutting die  for M 3 - M 12 external threads

BAER dies are used to produce metric external threads with a round external profile. You want to operate it by hand or by machine? Both work. These BAER dies made of high-performance high-speed steel HSS are suitable for normal applications for various materials with a strength of up to 800 N/mm². These include the following materials: general structural steels, free-cutting steels, case-hardening steels, unalloyed heat-treatable steels, pure copper, low-alloyed copper and copper-tin alloy (bronze) short-chipping, as well as plastics. The symmetrical design allows cutting in both axial directions. There are holes on the outside, here you can fix the die in the die holder and prevent it from twisting during use. All dies have an outer diameter of 25 x 9 mm, so all dies fit into only one die holder. The dies are cylindrical and have three or more cutting edges inside, depending on the size. The spiral point (spiral entry) ensures easy cutting and also good chip removal. The chip holes, which are holes or cavities between the cutting edges, provide the chip transport. They take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. The cutting tool has outer and inner teeth. The flattened outer teeth facilitate the gate, reduce wear and thus increase the tool life time. Each tooth takes a chip of the same width with it when cutting. The inner teeth have no cutting function: in the cut part of the thread they serve as straight guides. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste. You can find suitable cutting paste in our shop. Let the perfect quality of this tool and the strong price-performance ratio convince you. In addition to a fair price, our thread cutting dies for external threads can primarily convince with excellent quality. BAER cutting dies - for perfect external threads.

### The advantages at a glance:

- little space required
- Adjustment without effort
- Use on simple and multi-spindle machines
- simple tool assembly
- Use from both sides
- Outstanding quality at a good price. That is BAER.

### Technical information:

- DIN EN 22568 (formerly DIN 223 B)
- Thread tolerance: ISO-6g
- Chamfer: 1.5

## BAER actuation tools  \#Bear forces - thread cutting in the twinkling of an eye

Tool holders for manual actuation make the use of taps and dies possible in the first place. The adjustable holding tools are made of zinc die casting. They exert enough torque on the screw tap and dies to allow you to cut your threads by hand. BAER tool holders are stable and durable. See for yourself.

### This adjustable tap wrench made of zinc die cast is suitable for the following use:

- Square : 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- for screw tap: M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8

## BAER die stock  25 x 9mm \| M 7-9 \| BSW 5/16 made of zinc die casting

You need a die stock to hold round thread cutting dies. BAER die stocks are manufactured according to DIN 225 and convince by their easy handling. The five fastening screws have a tip that centres in the pilot holes of the cutting irons and thus prevents twisting during use. You can tighten these screws with the enclosed screwdriver, so you always have everything to hand. The die holder is made of zinc die casting and is resilient, wear-resistant and a perfect fit. Benefit from an excellent price-performance ratio. At BAER, you buy tested tools at unbeatable prices with outstanding precision for lasting stability and power absorption!

### This adjustable zinc die casting die holder is suitable for the following use:

- Diameter x height: 25 x 9 mm
- for dies in M and MF: M 7 - M 9
- for dies in: BSW 5/16
- Length: 224 mm

## BAER adjustable tap wrench  GR. 1.1/2 \| M 1-12 \| 1/16-1/2 \| G 1/8 made of zinc die casting

The adjustable tap wrench size 1.1/2 is an operating tool for screw tap from a zinc die casting body, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the clamping jaws, the handles and in the geometry, which make the tool stable and accurately fitting, manufactured according to DIN 1814. The long levers on the right and left help to cut plumb into the hole and easily apply the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. A lever can be twisted off on one side so that work can also be carried out in difficult-to-reach situations.

### This adjustable zinc die casting tap wrench is suitable for the following applications:

- for hand and short machine taps in M and MF: M 1 - M12
- for hand and short machine taps in UNC, UNF, BSW and BSF: 1/16 - 1/2
- for hand and short machine taps in G (BSP): G 1/8
- Square drive: 2.1 - 8.0 mm
- Length: 176 mm

## NOTE:

Please do not extend the handles of the tap wrench under any circumstances. The forces that can be achieved with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

![](https://assets.ebay.baer.tools/BMK312/BAER_ebay_015.jpg)

## BAER thread template  \#Easy determination of thread sizes

With the BAER thread template you can easily determine the thread size. It completes the BAER thread cutting set and you always have everything at hand. The high-quality thread template is suitable for determining the external threads of screws and for determining metric threads. It has thread blades with which all common metric pitches: 0.5 - 1.75 mm can be measured/determined. The thread is determined by the so-called light gap method. You put an appropriate gauge on the thread and hold it against a light source. If almost no light penetrates between the thread and the gauge, the thread size can be read from the corresponding thread sheet. The sizes are stamped on the respective sheets and can be read very well and permanently.

### Technical information:

- 52 blades, for metric and Whitworth threads
- Pitch 0.25-6.00 mm / 62-4 TPI W
- Weight: 83 g
- Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 5.5 cm

![](https://assets.ebay.baer.tools/BMK312/BAER_ebay_015.jpg)

## Quality  for long service life

The high-alloy tool steel HSS can work with up to four times higher cutting speeds than ordinary tool steel.

### This set is characterised by:

- Temperature resistance / heat hardness
- Wear resistance
- Cutting edge stability
- high smooth running
- good chip evacuation

This means that BAER hand taps and dies made of high-speed steel HSS can cope with many material requirements. Accurate work and long-term cost savings are added to this.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSE Machine Tap - 35° RSP - MF 20 x 1.5 - DIN 374

Our machine taps are powerful and reliable taps for efficient machining in one step with the machine. Machine taps are used especially in industrial manufacturing. They can be used in CNC machines, thread cutting machines, cordless drills and pneumatic tapping arms, among others. As they are characterised by high efficiency and low production costs, they are often used in series production. The thread is cut by machine in one operation. Thus, although the BAER machine tap can basically be compared with short machine taps, it is designed for use with the machine.

The machine tap can be used for blind holes, as the short chamfer and the spiral flutes ensure that the chip is discharged to the rear of the hole.

Every material shows individual chip behaviour. Therefore, screw taps must have the correct rake angle and - for even better results - a specially treated surface. This is the only way to achieve a good chip transport and to produce a thread that is true to gauge.

The high quality of the cobalt-alloyed HSSE steel we use ensures that our tools are extremely durable and robust. Due to special hardening processes and repeated tempering the hardness structure is very homogeneous, which forms the ideal basis for a genuine BAER screw taps. This increases the toughness and stability of the screw taps, allowing them to remain in use for longer.

## BAER HSSE Machine Tap - 35° RSP - MF 20 x 1.5 - DIN 374

**$47.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSE Machine Tap - 35° RSP - MF 20 x 1.5 - DIN 374

Our machine taps are powerful and reliable taps for efficient machining in one step with the machine. Machine taps are used especially in industrial manufacturing. They can be used in CNC machines, thread cutting machines, cordless drills and pneumatic tapping arms, among others. As they are characterised by high efficiency and low production costs, they are often used in series production. The thread is cut by machine in one operation. Thus, although the BAER machine tap can basically be compared with short machine taps, it is designed for use with the machine.

The machine tap can be used for blind holes, as the short chamfer and the spiral flutes ensure that the chip is discharged to the rear of the hole.

Every material shows individual chip behaviour. Therefore, screw taps must have the correct rake angle and - for even better results - a specially treated surface. This is the only way to achieve a good chip transport and to produce a thread that is true to gauge.

The high quality of the cobalt-alloyed HSSE steel we use ensures that our tools are extremely durable and robust. Due to special hardening processes and repeated tempering the hardness structure is very homogeneous, which forms the ideal basis for a genuine BAER screw taps. This increases the toughness and stability of the screw taps, allowing them to remain in use for longer.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 30 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M30 X 1.5 BAER ® TAP MF

**$207.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 30 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF 24 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## MF 24 x 1.5 HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) - LEFT

**$68.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Finishing (No. 2) MF 24 x 1.5 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) BSF 1/2 x 16

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## 1/2" X 16 BSF BAER TAP SET - 262272211 (P118)

**$43.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) BSF 1/2 x 16

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension G (BSP) 1/8 x 28. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## 1/8 BSP BAERcoil TAP (B3311)

**$27.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension G (BSP) 1/8 x 28. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Taper (No. 1) UN 1.1/4 x 8

* * *

The hand tap taper tap (No. 1) enables you to pre-cut a thread. The advantage of pre-cutting a thread is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The taper tap (No. 1) is marked with a ring and removes approx. 65 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

## UN 1.1/4 x 8 Baer HSSG Hand Tap Taper (No. 1)

**$167.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Taper (No. 1) UN 1.1/4 x 8

* * *

The hand tap taper tap (No. 1) enables you to pre-cut a thread. The advantage of pre-cutting a thread is that the cutting forces on the subsequent finishing tap (No. 3) are reduced. The taper tap (No. 1) is marked with a ring and removes approx. 65 percent of the thread profile. Because no complete thread profile is cut, the thread is not yet usable. Only when the finishing tap (No. 3) completes the thread in the last process is it fully usable. By dividing the work between two or three taps, it is easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 12 x 1.25

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Baer Hand Tap Set MF M12 x 1.25 (120301031)

**$31.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 12 x 1.25

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M8 X 1.25 BAER TAP SET -

**$14.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 8 x 1.25

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 6 x 1.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 6 x 1.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M9 X 1.25 BAER TAP SET

**$39.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 9 x 1.25

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## 3/4" X 14 BSP BAER TAP SET - 262532214 (P77)

**$81.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) G (BSP) 3/4 x 14

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M10 X 1.25 MF BAER TAP SET

**$26.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 10 x 1.25

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 30 x 2.0

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

**$86.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 30 x 2.0

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 16 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## M16 X 2.0 HAND TAP SET - 262735801 (P19)

**$35.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) M 16 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form C - NPT 3/4 x 14

* * *

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## 3/4" x 14 NPT BAER Tap

**$60.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form C - NPT 3/4 x 14

* * *

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## 1/4 X 18 NPT MACHINE TAP - 266351419 (P124)

**$26.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form C - NPT 1/4 x 18

* * *

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M22 X 2 BAER TAP (120301073)

**$80.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) UNC 1/4 x 20 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tapping hand tap set consists of three taps and enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. One left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## 1/4x20 UNC L/H TAP SET -

**$47.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) UNC 1/4 x 20 - LEFT

* * *

The left-hand tapping hand tap set consists of three taps and enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. One left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 18 x 1.0

* * *

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) UNC 1/2 x 13

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 12 x 1.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 18 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 26 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

## BAER Adjustable Tap Wrench - Steel NO. 4 \| M 11-27 \| 7/16-1'' \| G (BSP) 1/4-3/4

* * *

The adjustable steel tap wrench is an operating tool made of tool steel for taps, with which internal thread can be cut by hand. An all-steel tap wrench is ideal when a larger diameter of the threaded hole and thus a higher torque is required. The reason for this is that the higher quality of the cast steel also allows higher forces to be absorbed.

The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the high-quality clamping jaws, handles and geometry, which make the tool extremely stable and very precise to use. They are standardised according to DIN 1814, equipped with hardened clamping jaws and can be adjusted. The term "Tap turning tool" is also used equivalently in everyday life. These holding tools are not only used for thread cutting, because they and are generally used to clamp tools with square ends. For example, screwdrivers, reamers or insertion tools for thread inserts can be clamped. The long levers on both sides support plumb cutting in the bore and easy application of the required torque. Another advantage is the easy handling and the short changing times. In order to be able to work in hard-to-reach places, one lever can be unscrewed on one side.

### The most important at a glance:

- BAERENSTARK - Our tap wrenchs impress with their resilience and durability. Hardened clamping jaws for a firm grip and high-quality all-steel bodies.
- EXCELLENT QUALITY - At BAER you buy tested tools at bear-strong prices with outstanding precision for durable stability and force absorption!
- EASY TO USE - The tap wrench is characterised by easy handling and good weight distribution.
- APPLICATION - Tap wrenches are used for clamping hand and short machine taps. The adjustable tap wrench is made of tool steel.
- NOTE - The handles of the tap wrench must never be extended. The forces achievable with the normal handles are sufficient for thread cutting.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) UNC 9/16 x 12

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## 9/16 x 12 UNC Baer Tap Set

**$70.00** ~~~~

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (3pcs.) UNC 9/16 x 12

* * *

The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 8 x 1

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M8 X 1.0 (MF) BAER TAP SET - 262632602 (P43)

**$23.00** ~~~~

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 8 x 1

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M10 X 1.0 MF BAER TAP SET - 262633602 (P43)

**$19.00** ~~~~

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 10 x 1.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.

## Description

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) UNF 7/8 x 14

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.
