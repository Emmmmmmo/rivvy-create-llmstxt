## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 10 x 1.5 - 2.5 D (25 mm) - free running.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

If you have damaged threads, the BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution - while maintaining the same nominal diameter! By reaming and inserting a new EC thread, your old thread becomes strong and stable again. With the BaerCoil® thread insert, your manufactured thread becomes significantly more stable than the original thread!

BaerCoil® thread inserts are sophisticated design elements that ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread. They compensate for pitch and angular errors and thus distribute static and dynamic work loads evenly over all thread turns. This is particularly important in lightweight constructions where the carrier material is to be reduced. BaerCoil® thread inserts make it possible to use smaller and shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in the aerospace and automotive industries.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.
