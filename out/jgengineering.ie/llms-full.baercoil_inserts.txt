## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 5 x 0.8 - 2.0 D (10 mm) - free running - 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (Insert thread) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are essential for optimum force transmission in lightweight constructions. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual threads. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angle errors. BaerCoil® thread inserts not only save time and money, but are also much lighter and more compact than conventional screw connections.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. With the use of BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are an indispensable component in aviation and vehicle construction. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced manner over the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts helps to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Thanks to their versatility and reliability, BaerCoil® thread inserts are now an indispensable component in many industries.

BaerCoil thread inserts can be shortened to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

BAERCOIL


## M6 X 1.0 BaerCoil Inserts (Helicoil Type)

From **$8.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 6 x 1.0  - free running - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. With the use of BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are an indispensable component in aviation and vehicle construction. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced manner over the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts helps to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Thanks to their versatility and reliability, BaerCoil® thread inserts are now an indispensable component in many industries.

BaerCoil thread inserts can be shortened to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 10 x 1.5 - 2.5 D (25 mm) - free running.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

If you have damaged threads, the BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution - while maintaining the same nominal diameter! By reaming and inserting a new EC thread, your old thread becomes strong and stable again. With the BaerCoil® thread insert, your manufactured thread becomes significantly more stable than the original thread!

BaerCoil® thread inserts are sophisticated design elements that ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread. They compensate for pitch and angular errors and thus distribute static and dynamic work loads evenly over all thread turns. This is particularly important in lightweight constructions where the carrier material is to be reduced. BaerCoil® thread inserts make it possible to use smaller and shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in the aerospace and automotive industries.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts UNF No. 10 x 32 - 1.0 D (4.83 mm) 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. The inserts also create load-bearing connections in materials with low shear strength. thread inserts are precise and wear-resistant, holding your screw firmly in place without changing the thread insert. Ideal for repairing stripped or worn threads. wire thread inserts are often used in automotive, electrical, medical, lightweight construction, and aerospace applications.

For thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) for the wire thread insert is cut. Often this thread is also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert).

BaerCoil® thread inserts are perfect for applications where a balanced distribution of forces is required. They can withstand both static and dynamic loads and help save support material.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened with a side cutter or similar, according to the required length.

## UNF 10 X 32 BaerCoil Inserts

From **$5.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts UNF No. 10 x 32 - 1.0 D (4.83 mm) 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. The inserts also create load-bearing connections in materials with low shear strength. thread inserts are precise and wear-resistant, holding your screw firmly in place without changing the thread insert. Ideal for repairing stripped or worn threads. wire thread inserts are often used in automotive, electrical, medical, lightweight construction, and aerospace applications.

For thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) for the wire thread insert is cut. Often this thread is also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert).

BaerCoil® thread inserts are perfect for applications where a balanced distribution of forces is required. They can withstand both static and dynamic loads and help save support material.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened with a side cutter or similar, according to the required length.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Inserting Tool M 10 (and more)

With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way.

For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw.

The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation as this may cause the spigot to break off.

The throw-over tool has a 7 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible.

In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension. This makes it easy to work in deeper areas without having to sacrifice efficiency and precision.

### The hand insertion tool can be used for the following dimensions:

- Metric thread inserts: M 10 x 1.5 & M 10 x 1.25 & M 10 x 1.0 & M 11 x 1.5 & M 11 x 1.25 & M 11 x 1.0
- UNC thread inserts: UNC 7/16 x 14
- UNF thread inserts: UNF 7/16 x 20
- BSW thread inserts: BSW 7/16 x 14
- BSF thread inserts: BSF 7/16 x 18
- G-tube (BSP) thread inserts: G 1/8 x 28
- NPT thread inserts: NPT 1/8 x 27
- Harley thread inserts: Harley 7/16 x 16
- BSC thread inserts: BSC 7/16 x 26
- BSB thread inserts: BSB 7/16 x 26

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Inserting Tool M 3 (and more)

With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way.

For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw.

The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation, as this may cause the spigot to break off.

The throw-over tool has a 5 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible.

In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension. This makes it easy to work in deeper areas without having to sacrifice efficiency and precision.

### The hand insertion tool can be used for the following dimensions:

- Metric thread inserts: M 3 x 0.5 & M 3.5 x 0.6
- UNC thread inserts: UNC 4 x 40 & UNC 5 x 40 & UNC 6 x 32
- UNF thread inserts: UNF 4 x 48 & UNF 6 x 40
- BSW thread inserts: BSW 1/8 x 40
- BA thread inserts: BA 5

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 5 x 0.8 - 2.0 D (10 mm) - free running - 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (Insert thread) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are essential for optimum force transmission in lightweight constructions. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual threads. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angle errors. BaerCoil® thread inserts not only save time and money, but are also much lighter and more compact than conventional screw connections.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## M5 X 0.8 BaerCoil Inserts (Helicoil Type)

**$27.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 5 x 0.8 - 2.0 D (10 mm) - free running - 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (Insert thread) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are essential for optimum force transmission in lightweight constructions. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual threads. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angle errors. BaerCoil® thread inserts not only save time and money, but are also much lighter and more compact than conventional screw connections.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts UNF 1.1/8“ x 12 - 1.5 D (42.86 mm) - free running - 5 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are made of high-quality materials wire thread inserts. BaerCoil® thread inserts provide a durable and powerful threaded connection and scrap recovery in the thread repair. The inserts also create load-bearing connections in materials with low shear strength. thread inserts are precise and wear-resistant, holding your screw firmly in place without changing the thread insert. Ideal for repairing stripped or worn threads. wire thread inserts are commonly used in automotive, electrical, medical, lightweight construction, and aerospace applications.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads and that at the same time nominal diameter. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the manufactured thread is significantly more stable than the original thread.

Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Particularly in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your repair needs! With them you can create long-lasting and powerful connections. These inserts also ensure that you have no waste and recycle everything. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread - even in lightweight constructions. Due to their flexibility, they can compensate for pitch and angle errors and thus guarantee optimum force transmission. BaerCoil® thread inserts are already important components in the aerospace and automotive industries and help to reduce carrier material and use smaller, shorter bolted joints.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 24 x 3.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 24 x 3.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 24 x 3.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 24 x 3.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap is equipped with a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

**$116.00** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap M 24 x 3.0 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension M 24 x 3.0. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for M 24 x 3.0 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread M 24 x 3.0 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap is equipped with a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap BSF 1/4 x 26 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

**$34.00** ~~~~

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap BSF 1/4 x 26 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension BSF 1/4 x 26. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for BSF 1/4 x 26 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread BSF 1/4 x 26 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.
