## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut R (BSPT) 1" x 11 - HSS

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## BAER Round Cutting Die UNF No. 10 x 32 - HSS

* * *

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## 10 x 32 UNF Baer Round Cutting Die - HSS

**€16.26** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die UNF No. 10 x 32 - HSS

* * *

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) G (BSP) 1.1/2 x 11

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) G (BSP) 1.1/2 x 11

**€248.97** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) G (BSP) 1.1/2 x 11

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 1/2 x 14 - HSS

The hexagonal die (also called hexagonal cutting nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This metal-cutting tap has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## 1/2" BSP HEX DIE - 131501004

**€41.13** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 1/2 x 14 - HSS

The hexagonal die (also called hexagonal cutting nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This metal-cutting tap has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die G (BSP) 1/4 x 19 - HSS

* * *

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die G (BSP) 1/4 x 19 - HSS

* * *

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The die is made of the high-quality high-speed steel HSSE. HSSE is more heat-resistant, more wear-resistant and has a slightly higher hardness than HSS steel. the round die is therefore more durable and can also be used for demanding tasks. The improved surface finish, the spiral entry and the basic material HSSE give you the necessary strength for working with difficult-to-cut materials and stainless steels. The cutting tool also has a special cutting edge geometry so that it can be used in metalworking for, among other things, tempering and case-hardening steels up to 1200 N/mm², as well as stainless and acid-resistant steels, heat-resistant structural steels and malleable cast iron. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

The improved surface finish, the spiral entry and the basic material HSSE give you the necessary strength for working with difficult-to-cut materials and stainless steels. The cutting tool also has a special cutting edge geometry so that it can be used in metalworking for, among other things, tempering and case-hardening steels up to 1200 N/mm², as well as stainless and acid-resistant steels, heat-resistant structural steels and malleable cast iron. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form C - NPT 1/4 x 18

* * *

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 1/4 x 19 - HSS

* * *

The hexagonal die (also called hexagonal cutting nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This metal-cutting tap has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

## BAER Round Cutting Die BSW 1/8 x 40 - HSS

* * *

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. Round dies are cylindrical and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to secure the die in matching die stock and holders using retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

* * *

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension G (BSP) 1/8 x 28. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of dimension G (BSP) 1/8 x 28. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal initial thread G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 1/8 x 28 - HSS

The hexagonal die (also called hexagon die nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or drill press. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Die Stocks - Zinc die cast 1'' x 3/8

Our zinc die casting die holder is a very special holding or operating tool designed to hold a thread cutting die and operate it by hand. It is essentially made up of two components: the body and the handles. They are sturdily constructed and therefore very resilient and fit precisely.

The core of the tool is the body. It is provided with a round opening into which the round die is inserted. With the help of five fastening screws, which can be tightened with a flat-blade screwdriver, the round die is fixed in the die holder. The screws engage in the holes of the cutting die and hold it in place in this way in the die holder. The round die is then firmly fixed in place and can be removed. This gives it a tight fit and prevents it from turning when the thread is cut.

There are two handles on the left and right of the body. They allow comfortable handling and optimum distribution of the force. This makes it easy to cut external threads manually without using a machine.

The use of die guides is also possible due to the design. When using die guides, make sure that the holes of the guide overlap with the holes of the die so that the chip transport is guaranteed.

Once you have got the hang of it, cutting precise external threads by hand quickly becomes child's play.

### The perfect thread in just a few steps:

1. Before starting work, the bolt must be prepared. Clamp the bolt in a vice and chamfer the end. This means filing the edges all around at an angle of 45 degrees. This not only makes it easier to insert the cutting tool into the die holder, but also to screw it into the receiving internal thread later.
2. When the bolt is ready for use, the next step is to prepare the die holder. If the die is suitable for use with a die guide, then you can fit the die guide at this point. The guide will help you to cut the thread vertically. Then insert the die into the die holder and secure it against rotation with the retaining screws.
3. Cutting is made easier by using cutting oil or cutting paste. Apply a drop to the bolt and/or the thread cutting die in the die holder.
4. Now place the die holder on the bolt and turn it until the desired thread length is reached. Then unscrew the die holder in the opposite direction.

## 1" Round Die Stock Holder Zinc Die Cast (P139)

**€4.11** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Die Stocks - Zinc die cast 1'' x 3/8

Our zinc die casting die holder is a very special holding or operating tool designed to hold a thread cutting die and operate it by hand. It is essentially made up of two components: the body and the handles. They are sturdily constructed and therefore very resilient and fit precisely.

The core of the tool is the body. It is provided with a round opening into which the round die is inserted. With the help of five fastening screws, which can be tightened with a flat-blade screwdriver, the round die is fixed in the die holder. The screws engage in the holes of the cutting die and hold it in place in this way in the die holder. The round die is then firmly fixed in place and can be removed. This gives it a tight fit and prevents it from turning when the thread is cut.

There are two handles on the left and right of the body. They allow comfortable handling and optimum distribution of the force. This makes it easy to cut external threads manually without using a machine.

The use of die guides is also possible due to the design. When using die guides, make sure that the holes of the guide overlap with the holes of the die so that the chip transport is guaranteed.

Once you have got the hang of it, cutting precise external threads by hand quickly becomes child's play.

### The perfect thread in just a few steps:

1. Before starting work, the bolt must be prepared. Clamp the bolt in a vice and chamfer the end. This means filing the edges all around at an angle of 45 degrees. This not only makes it easier to insert the cutting tool into the die holder, but also to screw it into the receiving internal thread later.
2. When the bolt is ready for use, the next step is to prepare the die holder. If the die is suitable for use with a die guide, then you can fit the die guide at this point. The guide will help you to cut the thread vertically. Then insert the die into the die holder and secure it against rotation with the retaining screws.
3. Cutting is made easier by using cutting oil or cutting paste. Apply a drop to the bolt and/or the thread cutting die in the die holder.
4. Now place the die holder on the bolt and turn it until the desired thread length is reached. Then unscrew the die holder in the opposite direction.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap UNC 1'' x 8 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of the dimension UNC 1" x 8. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for UNC 1" x 8 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread UNC 1" x 8 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap UNC 1'' x 8 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

**€69.16** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil HSSG Short Machine Tap UNC 1'' x 8 STI (oversized for wire thread inserts)

BaerCoil® screw tap are mainly used for thread repair or thread reinforcement in connection with wire thread inserts. With this BaerCoil® short machine tap, a finished thread with oversize can be cut in one operation as a holding thread for wire thread inserts of the dimension UNC 1" x 8. Precise internal thread can thus be cut time-savingly by hand or semi-professionally by machine.

The holding thread for UNC 1" x 8 thread inserts is also called STI thread (screw thread insert) or STI thread (in English Screw Thread Insert) and has an oversize so that the normal starting thread UNC 1" x 8 is restored after installation of the thread insert.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows internal thread to be cut by hand without jamming and operated with tap wrenches, ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Pre-machining with a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2) is not necessary.

With the short chamfer and the straight flutes, the chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. To prevent the chips from sticking, it is recommended to remove the chips from the grooves with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread cutting. This form of gating makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for both through holes and blind holes.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut UNC 1" x 8 - HSS

The hexagonal die (also called hexagon die nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## 1" x 8 UNC HEX DIE NUT - 262313803 (P92)

**€95.94** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut UNC 1" x 8 - HSS

The hexagonal die (also called hexagon die nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.
