## M22 X 1.5 Baer Round Die

**€73.01** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 22 x 1.5 - HSS

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. Round dies are cylindrical and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to secure the die in matching die stock and holders using retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 1.5 - LEFT

The left-hand tapping hand tap set consists of two taps and enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. One left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.

The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than at coarse thread, as the thread profile area is smaller than for coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M22 X 2 BAER TAP (120301073)

**€66.64** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 22 x 2.0

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut MF 30 x 1.5 - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

Product information

## BAER Hexagon Die Nut MF 30 x 1.5 - HSS

* * *

The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 30 x 1.5 - HSS

* * *

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 30 x 1.5

* * *

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 30 x 2.0

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 30 x 2.0

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## M32 x 1.5 BaerTap (266653601)

**€91.41** ~~~~

Product information

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - MF 32 x 1.5

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2).

This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.

## Description

PRODUCT INFORMATION

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 36 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## M36 X 3 BAER TAP SET

**€232.37** ~~~~

PRODUCT INFORMATION

## BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.) MF 36 x 3.0

The hand tap set consists of two taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.

Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole.

Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.

## Description

Product information

## BAER Round Cutting Die MF 38 x 1.5 - HSS

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or drill press. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.

HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys. Also plastics such as POM, PVC etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.
