## Description

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 4 x 0.7 - 6 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 5 x 0.8 - 7 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

### Attributes

- Thread repair damaged or worn threads
- Scrap recovery
- Thread armoring of materials with low shear strength such as aluminium and magnesium alloys, wood, PVC, etc
- For example, in an application in light metal, a pull-out strength can be achieved that is higher than the yield strength of an 8.8 screw.
- Cutting the holding thread itself during screwing in
- high compression with the holding material
- very high pull-out strength
- minimises space and weight
- high corrosion resistance
- easy to use
- Areas of application in the entire metal and plastics processing industry

## Description

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting holes M 6 x 1.0 - 8 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.

- very high pull-out strength
- minimises space and weight
- high corrosion resistance
- easy to use
- Areas of application in the entire metal and plastics processing industry

## Description

These Faithfull high-performance, tungsten carbide tipped drill bits fit into SDS Plus chucks which provide a particularly secure, non-slip grip, that transmits maximum power for rotary percussion drilling, mainly into concrete.

The SDS Plus bits ensure maximum power transmission due to their unique fluted shaft. This effectively removes situations where a perfectly serviceable cutting edge is rendered useless by a worn shank. The SDS Plus system also enables faster changing of drills using a quick-release keyless chuck.

The drill bits are suitable for use in bricks, blocks, concrete containing aggregates, marble, hard stone and other hard masonry materials.

The Faithfull FAISDS65160 [SDS](https://www.toolbankb2b.com/g/SDS) Drill has a heavy-duty tungsten carbide tip with the following dimensions:

Diameter: 6.5mm

Working Length: 100mm

Overall Length: 160mm

## SDS Plus Drill 8mm OL: 210mm WL: 150mm

**€7.99** ~~~~

These high performance Faithfull Tungsten Carbide tipped drill bits fit into 'SDS Plus' chucks which provide a particularly secure non-slip grip that transmits maximum power for rotary percussion drilling, mainly into concrete.

The SDS Plus bits ensure maximum power transmission due to their unique fluted shaft. This effectively removes situations where a perfectly serviceable cutting edge is rendered useless by a worn shank. The SDS Plus system also enables faster changing of drills using a quick release keyless chuck.

The drill bits are suitable for use in bricks, blocks, concrete containing aggregates, marble and hard stone and other hard masonry materials.

* * *

The Faithfull FAISDS8210 SDS Drill has a heavy-duty tungsten carbide tip with the following dimensions:

Diameter: 8mm

Working Length: 150mm

Overall Length: 210mm
