## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 3 x 0.5 - 6 mm - 100 pcs.

* * *

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 5 x 0.8 - 2.0 D (10 mm) - free running - 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (Insert thread) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are essential for optimum force transmission in lightweight constructions. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual threads. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angle errors. BaerCoil® thread inserts not only save time and money, but are also much lighter and more compact than conventional screw connections.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## M5 X 0.8 BaerCoil Inserts (Helicoil Type)

**€21.92** ~~~~

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 5 x 0.8 - 2.0 D (10 mm) - free running - 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (Insert thread) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are essential for optimum force transmission in lightweight constructions. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual threads. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angle errors. BaerCoil® thread inserts not only save time and money, but are also much lighter and more compact than conventional screw connections.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 6 x 1.0 - 12 mm - thin-walled - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.

## Description

Product information

## BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 8 x 1.25 - 2.0 D (16 mm) - free running - 100 pcs.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery.

The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. With the use of BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread.

BaerCoil® thread inserts ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread, even in lightweight constructions. Today, they are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They save weight and allow the use of smaller and shorter screw connections.

BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.

## Description

Product information

## BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 8 x 1.25 - 15 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself.

If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant.

With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor.

Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.
