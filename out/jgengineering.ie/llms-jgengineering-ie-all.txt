## About Us

Founded in 1979 by John Grant, JG Engineering Supplies Ltd is a family-owned business with a proud history of serving the engineering and hardware industries. Before establishing the company, John brought a wealth of experience from his roles as a Senior Engineering Purchaser at Semperit Tyres Ireland Ltd and as a Mechanical Engineering Lecturer at Bolton Street College.

JG Engineering Supplies began with a focus on circlips, pins of all shapes and sizes, and helicoils, quickly expanding into a full range of fasteners in stainless steel, high-tensile, and other specialist materials. Over the past 45 years, we have grown and diversified, now stocking over 40,000 products, including a comprehensive hardware selection and also sell online under www.mydiy.ie

At JG Engineering Supplies, we take pride in our expert technical support, ensuring every customer—regardless of order size—receives the highest level of service. If you need it, we have it, and if we don’t, we’ll get it for you.
