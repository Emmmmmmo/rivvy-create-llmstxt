Equipped with a 230° adjustable cutting head, you can customize your cutting angle for precise pruning in hard-to-reach areas. The SoftGrip™ handles provide superior comfort, while the non-slip base ensures stability and control. An orange cutting support enhances visibility, allowing for accurate and safe pruning. Whether you're tackling overhead branches or trimming at ground level without bending, the Fiskars PowerGear™ X Tree Pruner delivers efficiency, durability, and comfort for both home gardeners and professionals.",
