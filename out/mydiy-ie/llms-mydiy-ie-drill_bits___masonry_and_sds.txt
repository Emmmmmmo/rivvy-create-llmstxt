## Milwaukee Power Tools SDS Plus MX4 Drill Bit Set, 5 Piece

{
  "price": "€70.86 inc VAT (€57.61 exc.vat)",
  "description": "Milwaukee SDS Plus MX4 Drill Bits with 4 breaker points to pulverise material more efficiently for faster drilling. The symmetrical 4 cutter (4 x 90°) drills perfectly round holes for optimal anchor fitting, whilst the 4 flute geometry ensures the optimum removal of dust and debris. A centering tip enables easy spot drilling with pinpoint accuracy. Enhanced rebar guards for an improved resistance when hitting rebar. The welded solid carbide tip (Ø5-10mm) allows for wider flute entrance, leading to increased speed. More carbide leads to a higher durability of the tip and higher lifetime. Variable flute design: thin flute at the tip for maximum debris extraction, higher speed and less friction and a thick flute at the base for higher stability and reduced bit breakage. Up to 20% more holes per battery charge vs 4 cutter drill bit in concrete and vs the previous generation. Made in Germany. This 5 Piece set contains the following sizes: 5 x 115, 6 x 115, 6 x 165, 8 x 165 and 10 x 165mm.",
