## ABUS Mechanical SCATOR-E Non-vented Safety Helmet

{
  "price": "€28.79 inc VAT",
  "description": "The ABUS SCATOR-E Non-vented Safety Helmet offers reliable head protection and is perfectly tailored to working on low-voltage systems or in the construction industry. It protects you from direct voltage up to 1,500 volts (DC) and alternating voltage up to 1,000 volts (AC) because the fully enclosed ABS shell prevents electrical currents from being passed on. This safety helmet is also suitable as a construction or industrial helmet for work in non-electrified hazardous areas. Equipped with a 6-point textile suspension harness for the perfect fit. PowerTriangle technology acts like a spring suspension absorbs part of the impact energy and thus reduces the energy transferred to the wearer's head. To prevent the helmet from wobbling and slipping, it has an angled neck strap. An adjustment wheel is integrated on this for individual size adjustment. There is also a choice of three different steps to adjust the height of the safety helmet to suit different head sizes. The helmet is fitted with a short peak so as not to impair visibility during work. It also features a headlamp holder, slots for visors and face protection, as well as the 30mm Euroslot for ear protection. Meaning it can be fitted with the appropriate accessories depending on the area of application.",
