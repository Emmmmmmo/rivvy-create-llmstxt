## Bondloc B572 Pipe Seal Slow Cure 50ml

{
  "price": "€23.85 inc VAT (€19.39 exc.vat)",
  "description": "Bondloc B572 White Pipe Seal is designed for the locking and sealing of metal pipes and fittings. The product cures when confined in the absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces and prevents loosening and leakage from shock and vibration. The thixotropic nature reduces the migration of liquid product after application to the substrate. Has a good chemical/solvent resistance to Ethanol, Motor Oil, Unleaded Petrol and Brake Fluid. B572 is unusual in that it does not fully cure until some 60 hours after application, allowing for re-alignment of elbows and joints. Replaces tapes and dopes, stops gas and fluid leaks on most metals and assists in lubricating during assembly. Will not shred or tear which would contaminate your system. Use it to seal against oils, gases, chemicals, water and steam etc.",
