  "description": "The Aqua Stop hose connector has an internal valve that stops the water flow when an accessory (eg a spraygun) is disconnected. This saves having to go back to the tap to turn the water off when switching between accessories. It also helps save water in the garden by stopping the water flow, thus preventing water being wasted. All internal parts are made from ultra tough engineering plastics for a long leak free life and the connection to the tap is guaranteed secure up to 10 bar, thanks to a triple locking system. The sleeve is easy to use even when wet due to the twin soft touch pads and the hose remains securely connected via the barbs that connect with the inside and outside of the hose. Hose kinking, swelling, and leaking at the connection point with the fitting are virtually eliminated due to the ingenious flexible hose-tail on the nut. Suitable for use with all 19 mm / 3/4in and 15 mm / 5/8in hose.",
