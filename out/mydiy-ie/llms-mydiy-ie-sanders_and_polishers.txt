  "description": "The Einhell TE-BF 18 Li-solo Power X-Change Belt File is a practical, handy tool for grinding and deburring hard-to-reach areas. The narrower 9mm grinding arm is perfect for tight spaces and for grinding very small, intricate work pieces. With the wider 13mm grinding arm, even larger, flat surfaces can be tackled. The grinding arm can be pivoted by up to 90°, which gives the flexibility to work from various positions and makes it easier to machine hard-to-reach areas. The speed regulator allows the sanding belt speed to be adjusted between 250 and 1,700 m/min, so it can be tailored to the work piece at hand and the desired material removal rate. This means the tool can adapt to wide variety of materials. For more time-consuming work, the handy and lightweight cordless band file has a lock-on button. The sanding belt can be changed via a tool-free, lever-operated mechanism, and the belt tracking is adjusted by a screw on the sanding arm. Thanks to its ergonomic design with Softgrip surfaces, the band file sits comfortably in the hand.
