  "description": "The Faithfull Ceramic Fan Heater has been designed to provide a controlled instant heat source. Its small size makes it suitable for use in any room and is ideal for use in homes, garages, warehouses or workshops. This compact unit features a ceramic PTC heating element that is highly efficient, providing instant heat on start-up. Coupled with the powerful fan, it distributes the heat over a large area (20m²). Two preset heat settings make the heater extremely economical, as the maximum output can be set at either 1kW or 2kW. The required room temperature can be set using the internal thermostat, once selected the self-adjusting thermostat will maintain the room temperature and adjust the heater's output accordingly. For added safety, the heater has a self-resetting thermal cut-out and tip-over protection that switches the unit off if it's knocked over. The heater also features a fan-only setting that is especially useful on hot days by providing a cooling breeze. Complete with 1.5m power cable and fitted plug.",
