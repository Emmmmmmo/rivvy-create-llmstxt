For the installation of built-in furniture, laying tiles, wallpapering and all installation work. Setting out without a single pencil mark - that's clean working! Combined tripod/ telescopic leg kit. Unscrew the tripod legs and screw together to form the telescopic leg - fix the LAX50 to the leg - and measure! The tripod covers a space of 0.6-1m. The telescopic leg can be fixed between floor/ceiling heights of up to 2.75m. If the LAX50 is placed on the ground, its working height is 7cm. Its versatility makes the STABILA LAX50 a regular partner for many applications. Stabila LAX50 Self Levelling Laser supplied with a combined tripod / telescopic leg kit. Range: 10m.",
