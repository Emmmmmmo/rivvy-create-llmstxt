  "description": "Few things are more dispiriting than turning the ignition key and hearing nothing. Just when you need your car to start, it plays dead. Worse still, it's probably your fault. Look at the lights switch - did you leave them on? Modern car batteries are very reliable, but leaving the lights on for a few hours will soon discharge them. Even a boot light or an interior light left on overnight can flatten a battery. And a car left standing for a month or so may discharge its battery just from the current drawn by the alarm.",

  "description": "The Turtle Wax Hybrid Solutions Fabric Protector 500ml is an easy-to-apply yet advanced hydrophobic stain-repelling coating for all automotive fabrics but specifically intended for soft top roofs, interior upholstery, carpets, mats and door linings. ‘Flex-Coat’ Technology incorporates Ceramic SiO2 ingredients which are easily absorbed into fabrics without causing any change to the appearance or texture. When applied to interior automotive fabrics the stain-repelling coating protects against common staining caused by drinks and food spillages, such as coffee, tea, fizzy drinks, chocolate and pastries. Its performance excels when used on soft-top roofs. It can be used on mohair, canvas and modern fabric roofs to create a durable hydrophobic barrier which actively repels water and oil-based road contaminants which cause unsightly staining and colour fading to your soft top roof over time. Your soft top will stay cleaner, more vibrant and resist staining for months.",
