## ABUS Mechanical SCATOR Vented Safety Helmet

{
  "price": "€28.79 inc VAT",
  "description": "The ABUS SCATOR Vented Safety Helmet offers reliable head protection and a high level of comfort, perfect for use on construction sites, in industry or in gardening and landscaping. The lightweight and air-permeable outer shell of the SCATOR makes it comfortable to wear. Thanks to the robust ABS material with high impact resistance, the head of the worker on the ground is reliably protected from impacts and falling objects. Equipped with a 6-point textile suspension harness for the perfect fit. PowerTriangle technology acts like a spring suspension absorbs part of the impact energy and thus reduces the energy transferred to the wearer's head. To prevent the helmet from wobbling and slipping, it has an angled neck strap. An adjustment wheel is integrated on this for individual size adjustment. There is also a choice of three different steps to adjust the height of the safety helmet to suit different head sizes. The helmet is fitted with a short peak so as not to impair visibility during work. It also features a headlamp holder, slots for visors and face protection, as well as the 30mm Euroslot for ear protection. Meaning it can be fitted with the appropriate accessories depending on the area of application.",
