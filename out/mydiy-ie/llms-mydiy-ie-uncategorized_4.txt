## Hultafors Quattro Bevel Square

{
  "price": "€45.63 inc VAT (€37.10 exc.vat)",
  "description": "The Hultafors Quattro Bevel Square is an innovative adjustable square which also functions as a bevel square and an angle finder. The rotatable blade features fixed positions for 45°, 90°, 135° (180°, 225° and 270°). By rotating the blade more than 180° the opposite side of the stock where there is no slit can be used - for example, to provide a straight edge thin sheet metal cannot slide into. By shifting the lever, the Quattro can also be used as a bevel square to copy any angle between 0 and 270 degrees. A lever allows you to lock it at whatever angle you like. There is a scale on both the blade and handle to measure angles between 0 and 90 degrees. The square is also completely foldable, which makes it easy to store and carry in the pocket. The blade is 45mm wide to accommodate work with standard stud dimensions and has a centre line making it easy to quickly mark out both sides of a stud. It also has scribing notches, spaced 5mm apart, which can be used to draw or cut a line parallel along an edge. A robust joint and a 2 cm long blade of 1mm thick, high-strength stainless steel provides a very durable design withstanding tough working environments, and will last a long time. Carefully selected materials and manufacturing techniques such as a CNC-milled stock and a blade cut with a precision laser provide high accuracy; angle tolerance ±0.06° (±1 mm/m).",

## IRWIN Weldtec Circular Saw Blade 184mm

{
  "price": "from €47.01 inc VAT",
  "description": "The Irwin Weldtec Circular Saw Blades have welded Carbide teeth for a substantially stronger tooth bond and longer life. The ultra compact carbide is 70% tougher than standard carbide for superior sharpness and cut quality. WeldTec on Circular Saw Blades is the welding of teeth to the blade as opposed to the traditional brazing teeth. This is ideal for handheld corded and cordless blades as the weld provides a strong bond in case of unexpected nail strikes or foreign objects embedded in the wood. The blades have innovative heat vents, and the fully hardened plate runs truer for longer and with more accuracy. They have alternate top bevel teeth for cross cutting and ripping in all woods.",
