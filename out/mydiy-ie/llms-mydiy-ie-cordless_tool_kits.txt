Impact Rate: 3,800/bpm Max. Torque: 205Nm Weight: 0.9kg 2 x 18V 2.0Ah Li-ion XR POWERSTACK™ Slide Batteries. 25% smaller and 15% lighter than the DEWALT DCB183 18V XR 2.0Ah battery, making it easier to use in tight workspaces. Stacked pouch cell battery technology provides a low impedance construction, meaning that the rate of flow of electrons is much higher thanks to the innovative internal pouch battery connectors and electrodes, providing a greater surface area vs a traditional cylindrical battery cell type. It also benefits from superior thermal performance vs cylindrical batteries. This increases battery durability, improves the cycle life and results. Also comes with 1 x TSTAK™ Kitbox.",
