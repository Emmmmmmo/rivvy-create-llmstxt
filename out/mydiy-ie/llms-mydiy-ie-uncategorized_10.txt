The square drive features a finger grip on the top (the ‘mushroom’ head) that assists with running down the nut until resistance is met. The square drive can also be removed and replaced in the opposite direction so the wrench can give torque control in both the clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. The ‘Industrial’ ratchet is specifically designed for torque wrench application and provides users with the perfect combination of strength, versatility and ease of use. Factory calibrated to ±3% and the new mechanism ensures that the accuracy is retained for longer. They have a new ergonomic handle with a high proportion of soft-feel, high grip material.
