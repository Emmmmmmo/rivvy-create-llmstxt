This brushless motor offers more power and a longer running time than conventional carbon brush motors. After registering online, the brushless motor comes with a 10-year warranty. The impact drilling function assists the user when working on tricky materials; the impact mechanism provides sufficient force to penetrate hard, brittle material, such as stone or concrete, when drilling. In addition, the impact driver has a two-speed gearbox for powerful screwing and fast drilling. The quick-stop function allows quick and easy tool changes for use in the high-quality 13mm metal chuck. When impact drilling, enormous forces are exerted, including on the DIYers themselves. For this reason, the user's joints are protected by the additional handle, which ensures pleasant working thanks to the ergonomic design and softgrip.
