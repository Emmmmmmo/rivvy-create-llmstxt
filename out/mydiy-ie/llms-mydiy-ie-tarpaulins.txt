## Faithfull Tough-Tarp Tarpaulin

{
  "price": "from €71.67 inc VAT",
  "description": "The Faithfull Tough-Tarp Tarpaulin is 100% waterproof, frost and UV resistant. Integrally bonded with water repellent and UV resistant materials (not sprayed on as a secondary treatment), and manufactured with polyethylene film, using patented multi-layered, cross-laminated production technology. Puncture and tear resistant, in the unlikely case of damage, it will remain localised and not spread across the tarpaulin, making any damage easy to repair without needing to replace the tarpaulin. Made to withstand temperatures between -60 to + 60 degrees, the material will not crack or flake even at such extremes. Plus, the benefit of zero-fade technology ensures these tarpaulins stay functional and looking good for longer. Featuring ultrasonically welded eyelets, which are reinforced by rust resistant aluminium inserts and heat-sealed hems, ensuring the eyelets remain in place - even when placed under the highest pressure/tension. The lightest and strongest tarpaulins available in our range and backed by a five year guarantee, however these have been proven to last much longer. They will outlast normal, woven tarpaulins, by up to 3 times. Tested and fully REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) compliant, plus they’re 100% recyclable.",
