  "description": "The Faithfull 1/2 Tonne Builder's Bag, also referred to as a Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container (FIBC), is a reliable option for industrial storage. The half-tonne bulk bags are spacious enough to hold a significant amount of flowing products like sand, gravel, soil, and stones, and are ideal for building, landscaping, construction, and agricultural applications. The open-top design allows for easy loading and unloading, while the four lifting loops aid with manual movement or the attachment to a crane or forklift. Although intended to be single-use, these bags can be repurposed for domestic or lighter-duty uses, partly thanks to their tear-resistant, woven polypropylene build quality.",
