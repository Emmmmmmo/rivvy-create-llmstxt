{
  "price": "€312.73 inc VAT",
  "description": "The Flex Power Tools VCE 26 L MC Safety Vacuum Cleaner is fitted with a manual filter cleaning system that has a handy and compact design making it easy to use and transport. The high performance turbine ensures both a high suction capacity and a high vacuum, giving an excellent extraction result. By using manual filter cleaning, the dust deposited in the filter element is quickly removed with a targeted blast of air. Levels are monitored to prevent malfunctions when drawing in liquids, thanks to the installed float valve. The soft start feature stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (5 Sec. Overrun) empties any remaining dust in the hose. It can also be used as a dust extraction unit thanks to its appliance socket and electronic automatic on/off system. Other features include: large wheels with two swivel guide rollers, a blowing function, suction control that varies depending on the attached power tool, accessory storage on the back of the vacuum and a filter bag made from tear-proof fleece for optimum filling.

Continuous automatic flat filter cleaning ensures no loss of suction. The flat-fold filter has a Teflon coating/nanocoating that allows optimum use of the tank volume. Flow sensor technology monitors the flow rate and emits a visual and audible signal to indicate any drop below the statutory minimum value of ≤ 20m/s. It is also suitable for wet vacuuming and fitted with electronic liquid level control to prevent over filling. There is a separate motor air cooling duct fitted with coarse dirt filter that protects the turbine against the ingress of ambient air and thereby extends the service life. Soft start stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (15 sec. overrun) empties any remaining dust in the vacuum hose. The suction diameter selector switch adjusts the flow rate to the corresponding task. It is simple and easy to change the filter, as there is no need to remove the suction head. The vacuum is fitted with a permanent power take off socket and an electronic automatic on/off switch. It has a double-walled, sturdy container with integrated grip recess for easy emptying. It has a dust-protected, antistatic finish that prevents electric charging of the suction hose. Equipped with large wheels and 2 swivel guide rollers made of metal.

The vacuum will automatically start when the tool does, making it a great dust extractor for DIY use.

It’s a handy size, lightweight, and has wheels making it easy to transport. A major feature of the CORE 140 Powercontrol is the 3-stage power control knob on the front of the machine that gives you the option to reduce the power of your machine in three stages; down from 100% to 80% and finally to 60%. The three most useful operating selections when using pressure washers.\n\nIt features an internal hose reel, connecting the Ultraflex high-pressure hose directly to the pump. The hose guide is built into the machine casing, so the Ultraflex high-pressure hose is always tidily stored away before and after use. With onboard storage for the assembled gun and lance, the Gentle and Rough cleaning nozzles, and the foam sprayer with detergent bottle. To help with the choice of cleaning nozzles there is a selection guide just where you need it, printed on the machine where the nozzles are stored. Its power cable can be securely stowed away using a neat retaining storage strap on the rear of the machine.\n\nThe Click&Clean system on the lance makes it quick and easy to change the nozzles. A bayonet coupling on the gun ensures positive assembly to the lance and compatibility to all other Nilfisk consumer accessories.\n\nIt has a reliable and long-lasting air-cooled universal motor, aluminium pump head, and auto start/stop. Quick connection of hose to the integrated swivel function on the handle and the new quick connect system of the hose to the machine, completes the easy assembly prior to use. It can also be operated from a standing water source such as a water butt tap.\n\nUnder the Nilfisk Cleaning Speed Index, it has a rating of 40m²/hr.",

  "description": "The Einhell TP-RS 18/32 Li BL - Solo Power X-Change Rotating Sander is powered by an Einhell PurePOWER brushless motor. This brushless motor offers more power and a longer running time than conventional carbon brush motors. Once you register online, the brushless motor has a 10-year warranty. Eccentric oscillation ensures the smoothest finish with high grinding performance and high material removal rates. The power can be matched to the material and job at hand by means of speed control electronics. The low-profile design of the random orbital sander ensures optimal handling, thanks to which the tool can be held close to the workpiece. For optimal control over the tool, the ergonomically shaped grinder has softgrip surfaces and a removable auxiliary handle. The Ø 125mm grinding disc of the cordless random orbital sander oscillates in a 3.2 mm-diameter circle. The abrasive paper attaches securely to the grinding plate by means of a micro hook-and-loop system, and is easy to exchange. For professional use without mess, the sander has an internal dust extraction system with dust collector and removable pleated filter. Alternatively, an external suction system, for example an Einhell wet/dry vacuum cleaner, can also be attached to the extraction connection. The on/off switch is dust-proof. Part of the Power X-Change family. Powered by Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries with a battery management system for a long life. Comes as a Bare Unit - No Battery or Charger supplied.

Pinkgrip will stick just about anything on a building site that needs sticking. Its amazing grabbing strength not only removes the need to pin under the work piece to prevent slumping, but its revolutionary initial Direct Bond eliminates the need for double stick methods. Pinkgrip can be used inside and outside and adheres to just about every building substrate, providing the following key benefits:\n\n- Enhanced slump resistance for quick and simple direct bonding to most substrates without the use of temporary supports in most applications.\n- Excellent early and ultimate adhesive strength on porous substrates.\n- Excellent gap filling properties to accommodate uneven surfaces.\n- Good nip off qualities to prevent messy stringing of the adhesive\n\nSize: 350ml cartridge.",

{
  "price": "€135.44 inc VAT",
  "description": "The Evolution R185CCSX+ Circular Track Saw is ideal for both trade and DIY users thanks to its powerful motor and optimised gearbox. When combined with the Evolution R185TCT-20CS blade (supplied) it can cut through a variety of materials such as mild steel, aluminium, wood (even with embedded nails), plastic, copper, PVC and more. When cutting mild steel the saw produces a square, ready-to-weld cut with no heat, no burrs and virtually no sparks, far superior to abrasive cutting methods. The saw features an adjustable cutting depth and 0-45 ̊ bevel capabilities for versatile cutting in any material. It also features channelled air flow and a vacuum extraction port, that helps to keep the cutting line visible. The electric blade brake and blade guard, (that closes in 0.4 seconds) improves user safety and reduces exposure to a spinning saw blade. The integrated LED light improves visibility of the work piece. Compatible with the Evolution ST1400 and ST2800 tracks (sold separately).

When cutting mild steel the saw produces a square, ready-to-weld cut with no heat, no burrs and virtually no sparks, far superior to abrasive cutting methods. The saw features an adjustable cutting depth and 0-45 ̊ bevel capabilities for versatile cutting in any material. It also features channelled air flow and a vacuum extraction port, that helps to keep the cutting line visible. The electric blade brake and blade guard (that closes in 0.4 seconds) improves user safety and reduces exposure to a spinning saw blade. Supplied with 1020mm of track which is perfect for making straight cuts in long or sheet materials with ease. The saw is also compatible with the Evolution ST1400 and ST2800 tracks (sold separately). These saws have been developed to be compatible with most leading brands of circular saw tracks.",
