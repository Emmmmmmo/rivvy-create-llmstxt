## DEWALT DCW682NT XR Brushless Biscuit Jointer 18V Bare Unit

  "price": "€362.76 inc VAT (€294.93 exc.vat)",
  "description": "The DEWALT DCW682 XR Brushless Biscuit Jointer has a brushless motor that provides powerful and consistent cutting performance. Its paddle switch design accommodates left and right handed users. The Biscuit Jointer achieves accurate results, thanks to the dual rack and pinion fence design, as well as tool-free depth, height, and bevel adjustments. Its integral fence allows users to quickly and easily adjust the bevel capacity from 0 -90°. For added safety there is an electric brake that quickly stops the blade after the trigger is released. Retractable anti-slip pins hold the material in place, further increasing safety. Compatible with DEWALT's AirLock™ system or a standard 35mm dust extractor to minimise dust during cutting (system and extractor sold separately). Bare Unit, NO battery or charger supplied. Supplied with: 1 x Dust Bag, 1 x Spanner, 1 x 35mm Dust Extraction Spout and 1 x TSTAK Case.",
