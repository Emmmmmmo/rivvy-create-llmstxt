A push button switch for inflating in the high-pressure range without presetting the pressure additionally simplifies handling. This way, no individual parts are lost. The high-pressure and low-pressure hoses can also be accommodated in integrated compartments in a space-saving manner. A practical handle and its low weight make the compressor a handy companion for on the go and at home. Supplied with a 3 piece adaptor set (ball needle, a tyre adaptor and a conical adaptor).
