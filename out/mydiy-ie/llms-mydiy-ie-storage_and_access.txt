## Faithfull 1 Tonne Bulk Woven Bag 135G/M2

{
  "price": "€10.68 inc VAT (€8.68 exc.vat)",
  "description": "A large builder’s one tonne bulk storage bag manufactured from a woven polypropylene for superior strength and tear resistance and fitted with four corner loops for easy lifting. Storage Bags are officially called ‘Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers’, but are commonly known as a bulk bags, tonne bags or tote bags. Because of their flexibility, bags are much easier to transport than rigid containers and are best used for the storage of dry, flowing products including sand, gravel, soil and stones but can also be used for waste collection and transportation. One tonne bulk bags are large enough for storing a significant amount of industrial products and are ideal for the building, landscaping, construction and agricultural industries, offering an alternative to metal skips or rigid storage containers. The open top allows easy access to the contents, and a flat base will remain stable when placed on any flat surface. These bags are both strong and robust and intended for single-use in heavy-duty applications, but can be reused for lighter duty work. Each bag has four 30cm lifting loops which can be used to manually move the bag or looped on to a crane or forklift for transporting across the work site or warehouse. Maximum loading weight: 1,000kg (single use only at maximum weight). Size: 900 x 900 x 800cm",
