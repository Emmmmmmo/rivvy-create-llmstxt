This brushless motor offers more power and a longer running time than conventional carbon brush motors. After registering online, the brushless motor comes with a 10-year warranty. Together with a powerful motor, the variable speed control electronics can be perfectly adapted to any task in soft or hard wood. The cutting depth can be infinitely adjusted and features an additional fine adjustment. Depth adjustment is performed with a multi-setting turret stop. The router is equipped with a precise twin-tube guide, a clamp (6mm and 8mm), and a spindle lock for easy tool changes. The LED light ensures the working area is perfectly illuminated. A plastic insert protects the surface of the workpiece. The soft grip handle makes for ergonomic and safe working, while the chip shield protects the user against wood chips in the field of vision, and the two-handed attachment helps to keep the unit under precise control during use. The edge trimmer base also allows edges to be beveled. Supplied with a parallel stop, compass tip, a copy sleeve and assembly tool, along with an extraction adapter for Einhell wet and dry vacuum cleaners and a handy storage bag for clean and safe transport.",
