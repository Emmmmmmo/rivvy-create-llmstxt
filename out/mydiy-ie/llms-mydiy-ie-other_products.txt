Flow sensor technology monitors the flow rate and emits a visual and audible signal to indicate any drop below the statutory minimum value of ≤ 20m/s. It is also suitable for wet vacuuming and fitted with electronic liquid level control to prevent over filling. There is a separate motor air cooling duct fitted with coarse dirt filter that protects the turbine against the ingress of ambient air and thereby extends the service life. Soft start stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (15 sec. overrun) empties any remaining dust in the vacuum hose. The suction diameter selector switch adjusts the flow rate to the corresponding task. It is simple and easy to change the filter, as there is no need to remove the suction head. The vacuum is fitted with a permanent power take off socket and an electronic automatic on/off switch. It has a double-walled, sturdy container with integrated grip recess for easy emptying.
