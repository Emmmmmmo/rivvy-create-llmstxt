As with all WEICON TOOLS cable strippers, the blades can be used to make both circular and longitudinal cuts on round cables (from 6 to 13 mm) in a single step. With a lockable adjusting screw, the depth of the blade can be comfortably and precisely set in steps of 0.1 mm up to 3 mm. This prevents damage to deeper layers. Two more blades have been added to the base of this handy tool. These are used for parallel cutting of the outer sheath or insulation. This means the outer sheath can be easily removed even in very narrow spaces, such as in junction boxes or cable ducts. The special design allows the stripping of longer sections at both the head and base of the tool. An additional stripping function has been integrated in the lower side of the housing.
