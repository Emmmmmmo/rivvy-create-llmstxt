Whether you’re putting buildings up or knocking them down, you need a powerful saw that you can rely on, with a blade that outlasts the competition to make quick and easy cuts. It’s built for long life, harsh working conditions and the toughest cuts. Offers up to 30x longer blade life than abrasive discs when cutting metal. Its diamond cutting edge is incredibly tough and can make over 1,000 cuts through steel. Cooling holes close to the edge expel heat to maintain optimum cutting performance.
