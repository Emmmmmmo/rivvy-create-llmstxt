This provides effective protection against overheating and ensures the right balance for optimum operating conditions. The battery can be charged irrespective of its charge level. An automatic check establishes conditions on which the charging process depends. In normal conditions, for example, the high-speed charging process is started directly. In other conditions, e.g. extreme cold or exhaustive discharge, gentle charging is performed at reduced current strength. This charging method protects the battery and is essential for ensuring a long service life. The intelligent charge control system controls each battery cell individually, ensuring that each cell is fully charged. This produces maximum supply of power. Overcharging is not possible, because even a charged battery can remain in the charger.

  "description": "The Einhell TP-CD 18/60 Li-i BL Power X-Change Combi Drill is powered by the Einhell PurePOWER brushless motor. This brushless motor offers more power and a longer running time than conventional carbon brush motors. After registering online, the brushless motor comes with a 10-year warranty. The impact drilling function assists the user when working on tricky materials; the impact mechanism provides sufficient force to penetrate hard, brittle material, such as stone or concrete, when drilling. In addition, the impact driver has a two-speed gearbox for powerful screwing and fast drilling. The quick-stop function allows quick and easy tool changes for use in the high-quality 13mm metal chuck. When impact drilling, enormous forces are exerted, including on the DIYers themselves. For this reason, the user's joints are protected by the additional handle, which ensures pleasant working thanks to the ergonomic design and softgrip. The LED light provides a good view of work areas, even in adverse lighting conditions in carcasses, arbours or hard-to-reach areas. Member of the Power X-Change family.
