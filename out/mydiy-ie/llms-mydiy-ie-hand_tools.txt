  "description": "Ideal for sensitive workpieces and right angles. The large, perfectly parallel jaw faces are characteristic of the original BESSEY K-body clamp. They allow easy clamping and spreading of sensitive surfaces and right angles. Also round and pointed workpieces. And the best thing is: thanks to their extra-large contact surfaces, the original BESSEY K-body clamp are universally applicable even behind and to the side of the high-quality profiled rail. This allows you to clamp in locations that conventional screw clamps are unable to reach. That's guaranteed! The K-body clamp holds workpieces exactly parallel.",

It is light and can be quickly and infinitely adjusted up to max. 100 mm. 2 Ergonomic 2-component handle. The ergonomically shaped 2-component handle is fitted with soft material inserts. This makes the handle pleasantly soft, as well as particularly resistant to slipping. 3 Softpads. Particularly sensitive workpieces are effectively protected thanks to the softpads.

This makes these vices both virtually unbreakable as well as much lighter than conventional grey cast iron, the material traditionally used for the construction of mechanics vices. Manufactured and machined to close tolerances and is designed to offer smooth operation and reliability. An integral anvil assists with the hammering of materials. Supplied with a swivel base allowing the vice to be manoeuvred through 360 degrees, and locked in position as required. This base can be bolted onto a work surface for additional stability. Plastic magnetic jaws can be ordered separately to allow the vice to be used for the clamping of soft, polished and round materials, without causing any damage. Code: FAIMAGVJ100.",

The vice is manufactured and machined to close tolerances and is designed to offer smooth operation and reliability. An integral anvil assists with the hammering of materials. This vice can be bolted onto a work surface for additional stability.

  "description": "The Faithfull Professional Lock Back Utility Knife is a pocket-sized, compact folding knife. It features an ergonomic aluminium casing with a durable zinc alloy blade holder and quick-release blade change. The folding blade holder allows the blade to be securely stored inside the body of the knife but can be easily pulled open and locked in place ready for use. After use, a simple press on the release lever allows the blade to be returned into the body of the knife for safekeeping. Changing the blade is carried out by pressing the side release button on the blade holder and then pulling the old blade out, the new blade can then be simply slid into position ready for use. The blade holder also incorporates a useful thumb pad for precise pressure control when cutting. The compact size and the light weight of this knife make it ideal for storing in your pocket, but it also has the added convenience of a belt clip. This knife uses standard trimming knife blades that are readily available.",
