  "description": "The Ronseal Garden Furniture Stripper is great at stripping away any existing stains, oils and paints that are on your garden furniture. It's perfect for when your furniture isn't looking it's best or you fancy a bit of a change. Simply brush on and scrub off, works in just 30 minutes and only requires one coat (stubborn spots may need 2 coats). Before you start, make sure it's a warm day (above 10°C) and that it's not going to rain. If you use it when it's colder it'll take longer to work. If it's too cold, it may not work at all. Give the furniture a quick wipe to get rid of any dirt. Protect any plants with a sheet to stop them getting splashed. USING YOUR GARDEN FURNITURE STRIPPER Put on some gloves and give the tin a good shake. Get loads of stripper on your brush. The more you put on, the better it'll work. It doesn't blister or fizz when it's working. But trust us, it is. Leave it for 30 minutes. Don't let it dry out, if it does it won't work. Then check to see if it's ready by scraping it with something sharp, like a paint scraper. If it's not, put a bit more on and leave it for another 10 minutes. You'll then need to give it a good scrub with a stiff hand brush. As it's coming off, pour on a bit of water and keep scrubbing. This'll help get it all off. If your furniture has slats, you may need to use a paint scraper or something similar to get where your brush can't reach. Finally, hose down until the water runs clear and leave it to dry. Let your furniture dry for a day or two, and then you'll be ready to put on a new finish. Cleaning up, scrape off as much stripper off your tools as you can. Then wash them out in warm, soapy water. Don't pour any left over stripper down the drain or into watercourses. Your local authority may have special ways to get rid of unused products. Coverage : 5.3m² Per Litre.",
