  "description": "Trend 225mm Random Orbital Sanding Disc with a multi-material, long-life zirconium abrasive. This self-sharpening grit maintains cutting performance by fracturing away in use to expose fresh, sharp-cutting faces. An anti-clogging open coat reduces clogging and allows for faster stock removal, especially on gummy, resinous timbers, fillers and paint removal. The elongated hole pattern ensures base compatibility and aids maximum extraction capability. Hook & loop fixing provides a secure fit to the tool base. Suitable for heavier sanding on fillers, drywall sanding on walls and ceilings, removing old paintwork, prepping walls. This hard surface abrasion excels on harder materials, especially metals.",
