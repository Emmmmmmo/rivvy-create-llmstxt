  "description": "The DEWALT DEWDT4031QZ professional circular saw blades are general-purpose blades ideal for rip and cross-cutting in natural wood, plywood, laminates, particleboard and MDF. The positive rake angle allows the blade to cut at higher speeds and the blade is ideal for both table and mitre saws. The blade also has engineered laser cut expansion slots that prevent overheating and warping and reduce vibration and noise. The Series 40 circular saw blades have consistently precise cutting from a balanced and tensioned laser-cut plate. It has longer intervals between re-sharpenings through the use of large mircograin carbide teeth. The general purpose K10 carbide tips are able to cope with wood and non-ferrous materials. In addition, the large tungsten carbide tips can be resharpened up to 15 times.",

## Faithfull Power Plus Safety Sitelight with Tripod

{
  "price": "€81.88 inc VAT",
  "description": "The Faithfull Tripod Safety Sitelight is designed for both commercial or domestic use, and features the latest SMD LED lighting technology. Combining a high light output with the added advantage of a low power consumption and cool running temperature, the LED site light avoids the burn hazards commonly associated with halogen lighting. Unlike conventional halogen tubes, SMD LEDs are maintenance free and more resilient to damage. This light benefits from dual power. In the event of a mains failure, the back up battery will power the light, ensuring site safety at all times. It can be powered by mains or via the built-in lithium battery which allows for 50 minutes of 900 lumen lighting. The battery is automatically charged when the light is plugged into the mains. The slim and lightweight die-cast aluminium lamp head is IP54 rated for water and dust ingress protection – while the impact resistant glass lens makes these site lights a durable solution. Its also fully adjustable and mounted on a sturdy floor stand – so can either be used as a pod light or mounted directly on to the telescopic tripod. Two twist grip locks enable the tripod height to be quickly adjusted between 1010mm and 2000mm.",
