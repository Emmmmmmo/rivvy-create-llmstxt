Typically: Coils of nails with diameters from 2.0 mm to 2.2 mm contain 350 nails. Coils of nails with diameters from 2.5 mm to 3.1 mm. Contain 225 nails. Roofing nail coils contain 120 nails, due to the extra large diameter of the head. 15° Collation angle Ring shank nails have a series of rings punched into the surface of the shank. A difference in the diameter of the shank is produced making it even more difficult to withdraw the nail. Bright finish is without any form of protection and is the most economical choice, but the nails will start to rust before nails that have a protective treatment. Used in applications where no protection is required, for example a one way disposal pallet. As all standard nails come with this finish. Galvanising, or coating with Zinc, is the best way to prevent nails from corroding. The zinc does not protect the steel of the nail, but is corroded first.

Since sticks contain fewer nails than coiled nails (approx 25) and less of them are loaded into the nailer, the tool is lighter. A simpler feed mechanism for stick nails also helps to keep the weight of the tools lower than for coil nailers for similar size nails. This is important when you are working up a ladder with your arm stretched out. (Remember only tools fitted with sequential trip should be used when working up a ladder). Smooth shank nails have exactly that: a smooth appearance. Due to their regular form they can be produced at very high speed and are therefore the most economical type of nail. However, their holding power is the lower than ring shank nails. They require less energy to drive them and the air consumption per nail can be lower. Sometimes it is possible to use a smaller tool to drive them. Ring shank nails have a series of rings punched into the surface of the shank. Again a difference in the diameter of the shank is produced making it even more difficult to withdraw the nail. Ring shank nails have to be produced at lower speeds and their cost is generally higher than for a smooth shank nail. The air consumption per nail is also higher, and the energy required to drive these nails into hard wood is very much greater. Bright finish is without any form of protection and is the most economical choice, but the nails will start to rust before nails that have a protective treatment. Used in applications where no protection is required, for example a one way disposal pallet. As all standard nails come with this finish. Galvanising , or coating with Zinc, is the best way to prevent nails from corroding. The zinc does not protect the steel of the nail, but is corroded first. The thicker the zinc coating, the longer it will be before the nail is attacked. The thickest coating is called hot dipped and is applied by dipping the nails into a bath of molten zinc. Galvanised protection is measured in Microns (each Micron is 0.000001 of an metre thick). The thicker the micron coating the better the protection level of the nails.\",\n  \"availability\": \"In Stock\",\n  \"product_name\": \"Bostitch Clipped Head 28° Stick Nails WW Series\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"28° Collation Angle\",\n    \"Smooth shank nails for high-speed production\",\n    \"Ring shank nails for better holding power\",\n    \"Bright finish for economical choice\",\n    \"Galvanised protection available\"\n  ]\n}",

Stacked pouch cell battery technology provides a low impedance construction, meaning that the rate of flow of electrons is much higher thanks to the innovative internal pouch battery connectors and electrodes, providing a greater surface area vs a traditional cylindrical battery cell type. It also benefits from superior thermal performance vs cylindrical batteries. This increases battery durability, improves the cycle life and results.

Its powerful 36V brushless motor allows the washer to deliver three operating modes, Low (70 Bar), High (80 Bar) and a Boost Mode (110 Bar). These modes increase the intensity of the flow of water from the source. In Boost mode, the pressure washer will allow a maximum of 8mins at 110Bar before reverting to the previously selected mode. Its durable body is fitted with large 20cm rubber wheels, ideal for tough work sites. A built-in roll cage helps to protect it from work site knocks and bumps, as well as allowing for easier transport. All the accessories are either attached to the pressure washer or stored in a large compartment, which reduces the risk of losing any of the accessories.\",\n  \"availability\": \"In Stock\",\n  \"product_name\": \"DEWALT DCMPW1600N XR Pressure Washer 36V (2 x 18V) Bare Unit\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Max.

Flow sensor technology monitors the flow rate and emits a visual and audible signal to indicate any drop below the statutory minimum value of ≤ 20m/s. It is also suitable for wet vacuuming and fitted with electronic liquid level control to prevent over filling.\\n\\nThere is a separate motor air cooling duct fitted with coarse dirt filter that protects the turbine against the ingress of ambient air and thereby extends the service life. Soft start stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (15 sec. overrun) empties any remaining dust in the vacuum hose. The suction diameter selector switch adjusts the flow rate to the corresponding task. It is simple and easy to change the filter, as there is no need to remove the suction head.\\n\\nThe vacuum is fitted with a permanent power take off socket and an electronic automatic on/off switch.
