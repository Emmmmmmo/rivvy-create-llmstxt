  "description": "The Record Power DS300 disc sander features a cast iron body, disc and table. This machine is more than capable of withstanding heavy sanding tasks. The powerful 1hp motor provides plenty of power and torque to easily handle large sections of timber. The finely ground cast iron table can be tilted from 0 - 45°, enabling precise sanding of mitres and bevels. A sturdy rack and pinion mechanism is used to tilt the table, giving extra strength to support heavy timbers. Many machines may look similar - but build quality, materials and power differ greatly, as does performance. The Record Power DS300 is for you and should not be confused with cheap lookalikes. The build and performance will speak for themselves.",

  "price": "€493.91 inc VAT (€401.55 exc.vat)",
  "description": "The Record Power WG250 Wet Stone Grinder with a range of high quality jigs and accessories is essential for many woodworkers and is also an extremely useful tool for general household tasks, such as the sharpening of knives, gardening tools and many other items. The WG250 is the result of research carried out with a number of renowned turners and woodworkers who looked at the other machines on the market and advised what they thought was needed to improve on what was available. There are a number of features that make this machine stand out from the competition - some small but significant details as well as some major points of difference to most of its rivals. It has a Friable stone is specially designed so that as the abrasive wears, heat increases reducing adhesion so that the worn abrasive minerals come away to reveal fresh and effective new crystals. With variable speeds from 90 - 150/min. The stone wears the diameter reduces. On most machines you cannot do anything about this, but with Record Power you can adjust the speed to compensate. The left hand nut thread ensures the grinding wheel is held securely with no danger of unwinding. The WG250 has adjustable torque so you can easily apply the correct pressure for the job in hand or as the drive wheel wears. In addition to the polycarbonate water tray, the WG250 features a drip guard to help protect the top of the machine and re-direct drips into the main tray. An integral storage tray offers a convenient storage space for the most used accessories such as the stone grader and angle finder. Included in this package is the WG250/K Diamond Trueing Tool, an essential accessory to ensure the outer diameter remains concentric and the sharpening surface perfectly flat.",

## WG200 Wet Stone Grinder 200mm (8in)

{
  "price": "€287.33 inc VAT (€233.60 exc.vat)",
  "description": "The Record Power WG200 Wet Stone Grinder offers performance and versatility in a compact and easy to use machine. Some machines rely purely on the weight of the motor to apply drive to the wheel. This can be insufficient for more demanding tasks. The WG200 has adjustable torque so you can easily apply the correct pressure for the job in hand. As the stone wears, its diameter reduces and so in effect the speed of the wheel's rotation is increased. On most machines you cannot do anything about this, but with the WG200 you can lower the speed to compensate. In addition, when you want to remove material more quickly you can increase the speed of the stone. For added safety, its left hand nut thread ensures the grinding wheel is held securely with no danger of unwinding. Supplied with: 1 x WG250/K Diamond Truing Tool, 1 x WG250/C Straight Edge Jig, 1 x WG250/P Support Arm, 1 x WG250/R Stone Grader, 1 x WG250/S Honing Compound, 1 x WG250/T Angle Setting Gauge & 1 x WG250/U Angle Finder.
