When cutting mild steel, the saw produces a square, ready-to-weld cut with no heat, no burrs and virtually no sparks, far superior to abrasive cutting methods. The saw features an adjustable depth of cut from 0-53mm and 0-45° bevel capabilities for versatile cutting in any material. Advanced safety features, such as channelled airflow and vacuum extraction port, help keep the cutting line visible, whilst the electric blade brake and blade guard, which closes in 0.4 seconds, reduce the time the user is exposed to a spinning saw blade.

It also features channelled air flow and a vacuum extraction port, that helps to keep the cutting line visible. The electric blade brake and blade guard (that closes in 0.4 seconds) improves user safety and reduces exposure to a spinning saw blade. Supplied with 1020mm of track which is perfect for making straight cuts in long or sheet materials with ease. The saw is also compatible with the Evolution ST1400 and ST2800 tracks (sold separately). These saws have been developed to be compatible with most leading brands of circular saw tracks.",

  "description": "The Flex Power Tools VCE 33 M AC Vacuum Cleaner is fitted with a high-performance turbine that ensures both a high suction capacity and a high vacuum rate. Continuous automatic flat filter cleaning ensures no loss of suction. The flat-fold filter has a Teflon coating/nanocoating that allows optimum use of the tank volume. Flow sensor technology monitors the flow rate and emits a visual and audible signal to indicate any drop below the statutory minimum value of ≤ 20m/s. It is also suitable for wet vacuuming and fitted with electronic liquid level control to prevent over filling. There is a separate motor air cooling duct fitted with coarse dirt filter that protects the turbine against the ingress of ambient air and thereby extends the service life. Soft start stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (15 sec. overrun) empties any remaining dust in the vacuum hose. The suction diameter selector switch adjusts the flow rate to the corresponding task. It is simple and easy to change the filter, as there is no need to remove the suction head. The vacuum is fitted with a permanent power take off socket and an electronic automatic on/off switch. It has a double-walled, sturdy container with integrated grip recess for easy emptying. It has a dust-protected, antistatic finish that prevents electric charging of the suction hose. Equipped with large wheels and 2 swivel guide rollers made of metal.

{
  "price": "€225.03 inc VAT (€182.95 exc.vat)",
  "description": "The Kew Nilfisk Alto Multi ll 22T is a multifunctional vacuum that is designed for indoors or outdoors, wet or dry, dust or rubble. It can even be used to empty blocked sinks, clean-out gutters and empty rain gullies. It comes with 3 great additional features as standard: Power Tool Take Off, Push&Clean filter cleaning system and blow function. It has a 30L plastic canister which has a dry capacity of 16L and a wet capacity of 14L, and is supplied with a washable cartridge filter and fleece filter dust bag. The washable cartridge filter means that you can move from dry to wet use without removing the filter. Can be used with or without the fleece filter bag. An electronic warning system alerts the user that the suction is dropping and the filter needs to be cleaned. The Push&Clean filter system enables the filter to be cleaned whilst in use, pushing air through the filter to clean any clogging and ensuring you can work longer without having to empty the tub or clean the blocked filter. It also has a Power Take Off socket that means that power tools such as sanders, planes and jigsaws can be used and the dust is extracted into the vacuum, not into the work place. Simply plug in the vacuum, then plug your power tool into the power socket on the vacuum and connect the hose to powertool, adaptor supplied. The vacuum will automatically start when the tool does, making it a great dust extractor for DIY use. The blow function means that even hard to reach areas can be cleaned, simply connecting it to the exhaust air outlet. The carrying handle is used for coiling up the power cord, hose hooks secure the hose and makes storage easy. The body of the machine is equipped with a quick park for the floor nozzle and tubes, and further options for the other nozzles. Other tools can be placed on the flat top of the machine when not in use.",
