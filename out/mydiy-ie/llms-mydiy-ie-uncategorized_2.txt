By using manual filter cleaning, the dust deposited in the filter element is quickly removed with a targeted blast of air. Levels are monitored to prevent malfunctions when drawing in liquids, thanks to the installed float valve. The soft start feature stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (5 Sec. Overrun) empties any remaining dust in the hose. It can also be used as a dust extraction unit thanks to its appliance socket and electronic automatic on/off system. Other features include: large wheels with two swivel guide rollers, a blowing function, suction control that varies depending on the attached power tool, accessory storage on the back of the vacuum and a filter bag made from tear-proof fleece for optimum filling. Supplied with: 1 x Suction Hose 32mm x 3.5m with Elbow, 1 x Filter Element Class L/M, 2 x 0.5m Aluminium Suction Tubes, 1 x Combination Floor Nozzle, 1 x Round Brush, 1 x Crevice Nozzle, 1 x Upholstery Nozzle, 1 x Filter Bag, 1 x PR Waste Disposal Bag, 1 x Suction Pipe Holder, 1 x Cable Hook, 1 x Flexible Hose Strap for Hose Holder, 1 x Rubber Tool Brush and 1 x Box for Accessories Holder.

## Flex Power Tools VCE 33 M AC Vacuum Cleaner M Class 1400W

{
  "price": "€832.55 inc VAT",
  "description": "The Flex Power Tools VCE 33 M AC Vacuum Cleaner is fitted with a high-performance turbine that ensures both a high suction capacity and a high vacuum rate. Continuous automatic flat filter cleaning ensures no loss of suction. The flat-fold filter has a Teflon coating/nanocoating that allows optimum use of the tank volume. Flow sensor technology monitors the flow rate and emits a visual and audible signal to indicate any drop below the statutory minimum value of ≤ 20m/s. It is also suitable for wet vacuuming and fitted with electronic liquid level control to prevent over filling. There is a separate motor air cooling duct fitted with coarse dirt filter that protects the turbine against the ingress of ambient air and thereby extends the service life. Soft start stops any voltage peaks at the start and the run-on feature (15 sec. overrun) empties any remaining dust in the vacuum hose. The suction diameter selector switch adjusts the flow rate to the corresponding task. It is simple and easy to change the filter, as there is no need to remove the suction head. The vacuum is fitted with a permanent power take off socket and an electronic automatic on/off switch. It has a double-walled, sturdy container with integrated grip recess for easy emptying. It has a dust-protected, antistatic finish that prevents electric charging of the suction hose. Equipped with large wheels and 2 swivel guide rollers made of metal. Class M safety vacuum cleaner, suitable for all dusts with OEL values ≥ 0.1mg/m³. Specifically for mineral and timber dusts (also beech and oak).",
