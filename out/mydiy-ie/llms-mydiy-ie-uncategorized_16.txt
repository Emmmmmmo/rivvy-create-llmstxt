  "price": "€33.05 inc VAT (€26.87 exc.vat)",
  "description": "Weicon® Precision S Stripper for fast and safe stripping of very fine conductors, strands or wires with small diameters 0.12-0.8mm (3620 AWG). With the adjustable scaled length stop for the working range from 5-45mm, the desired stripping length can be set quickly and reliably. Two durable, precisely adjusted torsion springs, which push symmetrically on the pair of blades with a defined force, ensure comfortable working. That way, the respective insulation is cut with the right pressure. In combination with the scanning system it is integrated in the tool, this ensures damage-free stripping. The tool is suitable for both right- and left-handed users.",

## Wiha speedEÂ® II electric E-screwdriver Set, 7 Piece

{
  "price": "€401.35 inc VAT (€326.30 exc.vat)",
  "description": "The Wiha speedE® II electric E-screwdriver is ideal for all screw-fastening tasks. Several fastenings per day, hundreds of fastenings per week. Professional craftspeople invest a great amount of time and energy in recurring fastening tasks. The resulting pain in wrists is the body’s natural reaction. Thanks to the electric drive of the e-screwdriver speedE® II, joints and tendons are protected, especially during continuous use. In addition the required time is reduced to one-third. An extra highlight of the speedE® II is the integrated material function. Sensitive fastenings, for example, plastic socket covers, must not be tightened too hard or the material will be damaged. In such cases, the speedE II automatically switches off at 0.4Nm and gives the user full control to carefully carry out the final fastening by hand. If there are fastening tasks requiring more force, the second generation speedE® offers the option of increasing the electric force to 1.0Nm via a sliding switch. The colour of the slimBits serves as an aid for adjusting the correct force level to the respective application. Red slimBits with the smaller profiles are used in the red slide position, while the yellow Power SlimBits with the larger profiles indicate in this case, the more powerful yellow slide position can be used. If more force is required, the speedE® can be manually used up to 12Nm without incurring any damage. The enlarged ring switch and smooth rotation ensure even easier handling. Thanks to the combination of facilitated handling and the ergonomic SoftFinish® handle design, the e-screwdriver speedE® II is recommended by doctors and therapists from the German Campaign for Healthier Backs. During the fastening, the integrated LED light provides permanent illumination for an optimal view of the screw. The powerful LED can also be used as a flashlight by tapping on the ring switch. slimBits are individually tested at 10,000 V AC and approved for 1,000 V AC. Supplied with: 1 x slimBit electric Slotted/Pozidriv Power Bit SL/PZ2 x 75mm. 1 x slimBit electric Slotted Bit 3.5 x 75mm. 2 x Li-ion Batteries. 1 x Li-ion Charger with USB. 1 x Mini L Boxx.",
