  "description": "The Bahco S4RM ratcheting spanners are made from top quality forged steel, nickel which is then chrome-plated in a matt-finish for a smooth and secure grip. Easy to use, these spanners simply grip the nut or bolt being removed or replaced, the ratcheting spanner heads are sized either side of each spanner for the desired size of nut or bolt, then just push the direction lever to remove or replace the nut or bolt with ratchet action. They are an ideal option for motor mechanics, motor cycle repairs etc., as these spanners can be used in awkward places and minimal movement action is required to use them.",
