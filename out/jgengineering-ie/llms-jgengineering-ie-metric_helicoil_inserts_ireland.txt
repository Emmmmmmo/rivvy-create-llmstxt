These inserts provide a long-lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. If you have damaged threads, the BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution - while maintaining the same nominal diameter! By reaming and inserting a new EC thread, your old thread becomes strong and stable again. With the BaerCoil® thread insert, your manufactured thread becomes significantly more stable than the original thread! BaerCoil® thread inserts are sophisticated design elements that ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread. They compensate for pitch and angular errors and thus distribute static and dynamic work loads evenly over all thread turns. This is particularly important in lightweight constructions where the carrier material is to be reduced. BaerCoil® thread inserts make it possible to use smaller and shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in the aerospace and automotive industries. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.",

  "description": "BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. With the use of BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread. BaerCoil® thread inserts are an indispensable component in aviation and vehicle construction. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced manner over the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts helps to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Thanks to their versatility and reliability, BaerCoil® thread inserts are now an indispensable component in many industries. BaerCoil thread inserts can be shortened to the required length with a side cutter or similar.",

  "description": "BaerCoil Wire Thread Inserts M 5 x 0.8 - 2.0 D (10 mm) - free running - 100 pcs. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. STI thread (Insert thread) is cut and the BaerCoil® insert is screwed in. The thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread. BaerCoil® thread inserts are essential for optimum force transmission in lightweight constructions. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced way to the individual threads. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angle errors. BaerCoil® thread inserts not only save time and money, but are also much lighter and more compact than conventional screw connections. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.",
