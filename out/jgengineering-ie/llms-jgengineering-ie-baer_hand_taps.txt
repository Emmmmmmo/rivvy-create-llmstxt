## 1/2" UNC BAER TAP SET - 262332203

{
  "price": "€44.90",
  "description": "The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.",

## BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20

{
  "price": "€18.45",
  "description": "BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20 is backordered and will ship as soon as it is back in stock. Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.",

{
  "price": "€6.65",
  "description": "The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.",

{
  "price": "€33.53",
  "description": "The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes. As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.",

{
  "price": "€56.78",
  "description": "The left-hand tap finishing tap (No. 3) enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread. It is advantageous to shape the thread beforehand with a taper tap (No. 1) in order to better distribute the cutting power. However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes. A left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise.",

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

## M16 X 2.0 HAND TAP SET - 262735801 (P19)

{
  "price": "€28.53",
  "description": "The hand tap set consists of three taps and allows you to cut a finished thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand.",
