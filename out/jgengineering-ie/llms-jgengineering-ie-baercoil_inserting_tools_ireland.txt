## BaerCoil Inserting Tool M 3

{
  "price": "€11.41",
  "description": "BaerCoil Inserting Tool M 3 is backordered and will ship as soon as it is back in stock. With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way. For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw. The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation, as this may cause the spigot to break off. The throw-over tool has a 5 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible. In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension. This makes it easy to work in deeper areas without having to sacrifice efficiency and precision.",
