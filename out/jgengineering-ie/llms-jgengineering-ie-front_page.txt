  "description": "BaerCoil® thread inserts are the perfect solution for your thread repair needs! These inserts provide a long lasting and powerful thread connection and scrap recovery. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads. With the use of BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly stronger than the original thread. BaerCoil® thread inserts are an indispensable component in aviation and vehicle construction. They ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed in a balanced manner over the individual thread turns. Also, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for any pitch and angular errors, so that optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts helps to reduce the carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. Thanks to their versatility and reliability, BaerCoil® thread inserts are now an indispensable component in many industries. BaerCoil thread inserts can be shortened to the required length with a side cutter or similar.",

  "description": "BaerCoil Spark Plug Thread Repair Kit M 14 x 1.25 - With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair spark plug threads or glow plug threads in MF 14 x 1,25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the combination tap with guide thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. For spark plug threads, no reaming is necessary because the combined drilling and cutting tool is used here. The hole is widened by the guide thread and then the thread is cut with oversize. For spark plug threads, the tang must be removed with needle-nose pliers. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened if necessary, according to the required length, with a side cutter or similar.",
