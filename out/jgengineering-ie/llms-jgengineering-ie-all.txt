  "description": "BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit UNF 1.1/4 x 12. With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind hole threads in UNF 1.1/4\" x 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 32.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.",

## 1" Round Die Stock Holder Zinc Die Cast (P139)

{
  "price": "$5.00",
  "description": "BAER Die Stocks - Zinc die cast 1'' x 3/8. Our zinc die casting die holder is a very special holding or operating tool designed to hold a thread cutting die and operate it by hand. It is essentially made up of two components: the body and the handles. They are sturdily constructed and therefore very resilient and fit precisely. The core of the tool is the body. It is provided with a round opening into which the round die is inserted. With the help of five fastening screws, which can be tightened with a flat-blade screwdriver, the round die is fixed in the die holder. The screws engage in the holes of the cutting die and hold it in place in this way in the die holder. The round die is then firmly fixed in place and can be removed. This gives it a tight fit and prevents it from turning when the thread is cut. There are two handles on the left and right of the body. They allow comfortable handling and optimum distribution of the force. This makes it easy to cut external threads manually without using a machine. The use of die guides is also possible due to the design. When using die guides, make sure that the holes of the guide overlap with the holes of the die so that the chip transport is guaranteed. Once you have got the hang of it, cutting precise external threads by hand quickly becomes child's play.",

  "description": "BAER Hexagon Die Nut R (BSPT) 1\" x 11 - HSS. The hexagon die nut is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, making it easier to reach inaccessible places. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.",

  "description": "BaerFix® thread inserts with three tapping holes are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.",
