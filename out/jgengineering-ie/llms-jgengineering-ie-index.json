With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind hole threads in UNF 1.1/4\\\" x 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 32.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"In Stock\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1 1/4 X 12 UNF BAERCOIL KIT B4138\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 1.1/4\\\"\",\n    \"Pitch: 12\",\n    \"Dimension: UNF 1.1/4\\\" x 12\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 47.63 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

Our zinc die casting die holder is a very special holding or operating tool designed to hold a thread cutting die and operate it by hand. It is essentially made up of two components: the body and the handles. They are sturdily constructed and therefore very resilient and fit precisely. The core of the tool is the body. It is provided with a round opening into which the round die is inserted. With the help of five fastening screws, which can be tightened with a flat-blade screwdriver, the round die is fixed in the die holder. The screws engage in the holes of the cutting die and hold it in place in this way in the die holder. The round die is then firmly fixed in place and can be removed. This gives it a tight fit and prevents it from turning when the thread is cut. There are two handles on the left and right of the body. They allow comfortable handling and optimum distribution of the force. This makes it easy to cut external threads manually without using a machine. The use of die guides is also possible due to the design. When using die guides, make sure that the holes of the guide overlap with the holes of the die so that the chip transport is guaranteed. Once you have got the hang of it, cutting precise external threads by hand quickly becomes child's play.\",\n  \"availability\": \"In Stock\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1\\\" Round Die Stock Holder Zinc Die Cast (P139)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 9.5 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 25.4 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: 1\\\" x 3/8\",\n    \"Length: 224 mm\",\n    \"Product group: Operating tools\",\n    \"Product type: Die Holders\",\n    \"Material: Die casting\"\n  ]\n}",
