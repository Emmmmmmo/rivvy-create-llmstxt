Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and the special die holders also allow you to attach the round die to a tailstock or drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm². BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw. To assist with the repair, in addition to the thread inserts, the set includes a core drill bit, a taper countersink and an assembly tool.

For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Cutting dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. This is a left-hand cutting die that can be used to make left-hand thread. Round dies are cylindrical and are used to make external threads in one operation. On the outer casing of the round die there are four holes and a groove which are used to fix the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BAER HSSG Short Machine Tap Form D - PG 7 x 20\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 7\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.492\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 12.5\",\n    \"Pitch: 20\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1.27\",\n    \"Dimension: PG 7 x 20\",\n    \"Product group: Screw taps\",\n    \"Product type: Short machine taps\",\n    \"Thread standard: PG: Armored conduit thread according to DIN 40430\",\n    \"Tolerance: medium\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 40432\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: up to 900 N/mm² | 27.1 HRC\",\n    \"Material: HSSG bright\"\n  ]\n}",

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M12 X 1.25 Baer® HEX DIE -\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 10 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 12 mm\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.472\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 12\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 12 x 1.25\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Thread standard: MF: Metric ISO fine thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO-6g\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in M 7 x 1.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert.

With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections.

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in UNF 1\\\" x 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 26 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"UNF 1\\\" x 12 BaerCoil Kit\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 1\\\"\",\n    \"Pitch: 12\",\n    \"Dimension: UNF 1\\\" x 12\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 38.1 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BAER Hexagon Die Nut M 10 x 1.5 - HSS\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 11 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 10 mm\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.394\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 10\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: M 10 x 1.5\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO-6g\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in M 6 x 1.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M6 x 1.0 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 6\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.0\",\n    \"Dimension: M 6 x 1.0\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 9 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind-hole threads in UNC No. 3 x 48. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

The hexagonal die (also called hexagon die nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M22 x 2.5 BAER Hexagon Die Nut HSS\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 22 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 22 mm\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.866\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 22\",\n    \"Pitch: 2.5 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: M 22 x 2.5\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO-6g\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair spark plug threads or glow plug threads in MF 14 x 1,25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the combination tap with guide thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. For spark plug threads, no reaming is necessary because the combined drilling and cutting tool is used here. The hole is widened by the guide thread and then the thread is cut with oversize. For spark plug threads, the tang must be removed with needle-nose pliers.

With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way. For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw. The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation, as this may cause the spigot to break off. The throw-over tool has a 5 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible. In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 24 x 2.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 24.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in M 12 x 1.75. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your spark plug thread or glow plug thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection with the spark plug or glow plug is no longer possible. This is where the self-tapping BaerFix® thread insert comes into play. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen the existing thread. If the thread in your cylinder head is damaged, this does not have to be a scrap. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded with higher pull-out strength at the same time and also becomes more wear-resistant. The thread inserts are designed so that the sealing ring of the spark plug protrudes beyond the thread insert. The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with tapping holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for light and difficult-to-machine materials.

    "markdown": "{\n  \"price\": \"€532.71\",\n  \"description\": \"BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 27 x 3.0. With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 27 x 3.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 27.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M27 X 3 BaerCoil® Kit - B4050\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 27\",\n    \"Pitch: 3.0\",\n    \"Dimension: M 27 x 3.0\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 40.5 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BaerFix with cutting slots M 10 x 1,5 - 18 mm\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 10\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5\",\n    \"Dimension: M 10 x 1.5\",\n    \"Product group: Self-cutting thread inserts\",\n    \"Product type: BaerFix self-cutting inserts with cutting slots\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO2/6H\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Type: with cutting slots\",\n    \"Material: Case-hardened steel, galvanized\",\n    \"Maximum insertion torque: 40 Nm\",\n    \"Speed guide value for light metals: 200-300 R/min\",\n    \"Min. drilling depth for through hole: 18.00 mm\",\n    \"Min. drilling depth for blind hole: 22.00 mm\"\n  ]\n}",

This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm².

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind-hole threads in UNC 5/16 x 18. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BaerFix Thread Inserts with cutting slots M 5 x 0.8 - 10 mm - 1.4305 - 100 pcs.\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 5\",\n    \"Pitch: 0.8\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel 1.4305 (AISI 303)\",\n    \"Type: with cutting slots\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Maximum insertion torque: 10 Nm\",\n    \"Speed guide value for light metals: 400-600 R/min\",\n    \"Drilling depth for through hole: 10.00 mm\",\n    \"Drilling depth for blind hole: 13.00 mm\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 24 x 2.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 24.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M24 X 2.0 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 24\",\n    \"Pitch: 2.0\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 24 x 2.0\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 36 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 20.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 5 - 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair magazine contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand taps with oversize for insert threads, insertion tools, tang breakers and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 3 - 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair magazine contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand taps with oversize for insert threads, insertion tools, tang breakers and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BAER Hexagon Die Nut G (BSP) 3/4 x 14 - HSS\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 16 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 3/4\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 1.041\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 26.44\",\n    \"Pitch: 14\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1.814\",\n    \"Dimension: G (BSP) 3/4 x 14\",\n    \"Product group: Round cutting die\",\n    \"Product type: Hexagon die nuts\",\n    \"Thread standard: G (BSP): British Standard Pipe Thread according to DIN ISO 228 - Cylindrical pipe thread\",\n    \"Tolerance: A\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\",\n    \"Material: HSS\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind hole threads in G (BSP) 3/8 x 19. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. No tang breaker is included in this set. The tang can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tang. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"G (BSP) 3/8 x 19 BaerCoil® Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 3/8\",\n    \"Pitch: 19\",\n    \"Dimension: G (BSP) 3/8 x 19\",\n    \"Length: 2,0 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 19,05 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M10 X 1.5 BAER ROUND DIE - 262744601 (P36)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 11 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 10 mm\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.394\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 10\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: M 10 x 1.5\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Tolerance: 6e Untermaß\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 223 (DIN EN 2256)\"\n  ]\n}",

The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 24.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M24 X 3.0 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 24\",\n    \"Pitch: 3.0\",\n    \"Dimension: M 24 x 3.0\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 36 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

With the BaerFix® spark plug thread repair set, damaged MF 12 x 1.25 threads can be repaired quickly and easily. This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm². BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw. To assist with the repair, in addition to the thread inserts, the set includes a core drill bit, a taper countersink and an assembly tool.

An all-steel tap wrench is ideal when a larger diameter of the threaded hole and thus a higher torque is required. The reason for this is that the higher quality of the cast steel also allows higher forces to be absorbed. The outstanding quality of the tap wrench lies not only in the material, but also in the high-quality clamping jaws, handles and geometry, which make the tool extremely stable and very precise to use. They are standardised according to DIN 1814, equipped with hardened clamping jaws and can be adjusted. The term \\\"Tap turning tool\\\" is also used equivalently in everyday life. These holding tools are not only used for thread cutting, because they and are generally used to clamp tools with square ends. For example, screwdrivers, reamers or insertion tools for thread inserts can be clamped. The long levers on both sides support plumb cutting in the bore and easy application of the required torque.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 33 x 2.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 33.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in UNC 7/16 x 14. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"UNC 7/16 x 14 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 7/16\",\n    \"Pitch: 14\",\n    \"Dimension: UNC 7/16 x 14\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 16.67 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect.

In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw. The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation as this may cause the spigot to break off. The throw-over tool has a 7 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet.

The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting.

One left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 15 x 1.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in UNC 1/2 x 13. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in UNF No. 8 x 36. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert.

With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind hole threads in UNF 1.1/4\\\" x 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 32.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

Our machine taps are powerful and reliable taps for efficient machining in one step with the machine. Machine taps are used especially in industrial manufacturing. They can be used in CNC machines, thread cutting machines, cordless drills and pneumatic tapping arms, among others. As they are characterised by high efficiency and low production costs, they are often used in series production. The thread is cut by machine in one operation. Thus, although the BAER machine tap can basically be compared with short machine taps, it is designed for use with the machine. The machine tap can be used for blind holes, as the short chamfer and the spiral flutes ensure that the chip is discharged to the rear of the hole. Every material shows individual chip behaviour. Therefore, screw taps must have the correct rake angle and - for even better results - a specially treated surface. This is the only way to achieve a good chip transport and to produce a thread that is true to gauge. The high quality of the cobalt-alloyed HSSE steel we use ensures that our tools are extremely durable and robust. Due to special hardening processes and repeated tempering the hardness structure is very homogeneous, which forms the ideal basis for a genuine BAER screw taps.

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BaerFix with cutting holes M 8 x 1,25 - 9 mm - 100 pcs.\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 8\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25\",\n    \"Dimension: M 8 x 1.25\",\n    \"Product group: Self-cutting thread inserts\",\n    \"Speed guide value for light metals: 280-400 R/min\",\n    \"Product type: BaerFix self-cutting inserts with cutting holes\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO2/6H\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Type: with cutting holes\",\n    \"Material: Case-hardened steel, galvanized\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 18 x 2.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, an 18.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in UNF 5/8 x 18. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 16.3 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use.

HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm².

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1/4 X 18 NPT MACHINE TAP - 266351419 (P124)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 1/4\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 13,62\",\n    \"Pitch: 18\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1,41\",\n    \"Dimension: NPT 1/4 x 18\",\n    \"Square: 9 mm\",\n    \"Product group: Screw taps\",\n    \"Product type: Short machine taps\",\n    \"Thread standard: NPT: National Pipe Thread or American pipe thread according to ANSI B 1.20.1\",\n    \"Tolerance: medium\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: Factory standard\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: up to 900 N/mm² | 27.1 HRC\",\n    \"Material: HSSG bright\"\n  ]\n}",

This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

This BaerCoil® thread repair-set is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 13 x 1.25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. No tang breaker is included in this set. The tang can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tang. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in UNC 9/16 x 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 14.8 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm². BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw. To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair spark plug threads or glow plug threads in MF 14 x 1,25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the combination tap with guide thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. For spark plug threads, no reaming is necessary because the combined drilling and cutting tool is used here. The hole is widened by the guide thread and then the thread is cut with oversize. For spark plug threads, the tang must be removed with needle-nose pliers.

With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

The die is a reliable and durable tool that helps you to produce precise external threads in one operation. It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels.

The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in M 4 x 0.7. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 8 x 1.25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M8 X 1.25 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 8\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25\",\n    \"Dimension: M 8 x 1.25\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 12 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 22 x 2.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 22.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M22 x 2.5 BaerCoil Kits (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 22\",\n    \"Pitch: 2.5\",\n    \"Dimension: M 22 x 2.5\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 33 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair spark plug threads or glow plug threads in MF 10 x 1.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the combination tap with guide thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. For spark plug threads, no reaming is necessary because the combined drilling and cutting tool is used here. The hole is widened by the guide thread and then the thread is cut with oversize. For spark plug threads, the tang must be removed with needle-nose pliers.

The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and the special die holders also allow you to attach the round die to a tailstock or drill. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or to a drill. The dies can be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 14 x 1.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. No tang breaker is included in this set. The tang can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tang. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting.

HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm².

The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

With the manual BaerCoil® installation tool for wire thread inserts you can install the wire thread inserts in your workpiece in a simple and efficient way. For precise depth limitation, the insertion tool is equipped with a locking ring. In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw. The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove. Then screw the thread insert into the receiving thread under slight pressure until it is 1/4 - 1/2 turn below the surface. Care must be taken not to turn the insert against the direction of rotation, as this may cause the spigot to break off. The throw-over tool has a 5 mm square drive, i.e. the insertion tool can be driven like a screw tap with a tap wrench or a tool ratchet. In this way, convenient and effort-saving handling during assembly is possible. In case the thread is deeper than expected, the installation tool can be extended quite easily with our tap extension.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 18 x 1.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, an 18.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Sold out\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M18 X 1.5 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 18\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 18 x 1.5\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 27 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes. As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than at coarse thread, as the thread profile area is smaller than for coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M22 X 1.5 LEFT HAND TAP SET\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 22\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.866\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 22\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1.5\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 22 x 1.5\",\n    \"Product group: Screw taps\",\n    \"Product type: Hand tap sets\",\n    \"Thread standard: MF: Metric ISO fine thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO2/6H\",\n    \"Direction: Left\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 2181\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: up to 900 N/mm² | 27.1 HRC\",\n    \"Material: HSSG bright\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 22 x 1.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 22.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

In order to be able to precisely control the installation depth of the thread inserts, the locking ring can be loosened and adjusted in height with a simple grub screw. The locking ring must be fixed so that the tang of the thread insert is in the centre of the groove.

BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. Round dies are cylindrical and are used to make external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in matching die stock and holders using retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The external thread cutting tool is made of high speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M15 X 1.5 BAER ROUND DIE - 262646001 (P67)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 10 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 15 mm\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.591\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 15\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 15 x 1.5\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Thread standard: MF: Metric ISO fine thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO-6g\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 223 (DIN EN 2256)\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind-hole threads in UNC No. 8 x 32. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in M 10 x 1.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M10 X 1.5 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 10\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5\",\n    \"Length when installed: 15 mm\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304)\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. This cutting tool has an external hexagon and has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1/8 x 28 BSP BAER® HEXAGON DIE NUTS (262551214)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 11 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 1/8\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.383\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 9.73\",\n    \"Pitch: 28\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 0.907\",\n    \"Dimension: G (BSP) 1/8 x 28\",\n    \"Product group: Round cutting die\",\n    \"Product type: Hexagon die nuts\",\n    \"Thread standard: G (BSP): British Standard Pipe Thread according to DIN ISO 228 - Cylindrical pipe thread\",\n    \"Tolerance: A\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\",\n    \"Material: HSS\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 10 x 1,25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. Round dies are cylindrical in shape and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to fasten the die in suitable die holder and holders by means of retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill. The die is made of the high-quality high-speed steel HSSE. HSSE is more heat-resistant, more wear-resistant and has a slightly higher hardness than HSS steel. the round die is therefore more durable and can also be used for demanding tasks. The improved surface finish, the spiral entry and the basic material HSSE give you the necessary strength for working with difficult-to-cut materials and stainless steels. The cutting tool also has a special cutting edge geometry so that it can be used in metalworking for, among other things, tempering and case-hardening steels up to 1200 N/mm², as well as stainless and acid-resistant steels, heat-resistant structural steels and malleable cast iron.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind hole threads in G (BSP) 1/4 x 19. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"3/4\\\" x 14 NPT BAER Tap\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 3/4\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 26,57\",\n    \"Pitch: 14\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1,81\",\n    \"Dimension: NPT 3/4 x 14\",\n    \"Square: 16 mm\",\n    \"Product group: Screw taps\",\n    \"Product type: Short machine taps\",\n    \"Thread standard: NPT: National Pipe Thread or American pipe thread according to ANSI B 1.20.1\",\n    \"Tolerance: medium\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: Factory standard\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: up to 900 N/mm² | 27.1 HRC\",\n    \"Material: HSSG bright\"\n  ]\n}",

The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. This is a left-hand cutting nut used to make left-hand thread. The hexagon die nut is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"BAER Hexagon Die Nut UNC 1/2 x 13 - HSS\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 14 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 1/2\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.5\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 12.7\",\n    \"Pitch: 13\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1.954\",\n    \"Dimension: UNC 1/2 x 13\",\n    \"Product group: Round cutting die\",\n    \"Product type: Hexagon die nuts\",\n    \"Thread standard: UNC: American Unified National Coarse thread according to ANSI B1.1\",\n    \"Tolerance: 2A\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\",\n    \"Material: HSS\"\n  ]\n}",

Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations.

The hexagonal die (also called hexagon die nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

    "markdown": "{\n  \"price\": \"€86.30\",\n  \"description\": \"BaerCoil Thread Repair Kit M 16 x 2.0. With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 16 x 2.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 16.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M16 X 2.0 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 16\",\n    \"Pitch: 2.0\",\n    \"Dimension: M 16 x 2.0\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 24 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

The hexagonal die (also called hexagonal cutting nut) is particularly advantageous for repairs, as it can be moved with ring spanners or open-end spanners, allowing you to reach inaccessible places more easily. BAER thread cutting dies are threading tools that are perfect for external threads. This metal-cutting tap has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 5 x 0.8. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 27 x 2.0. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 27.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back.

HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1/8\\\" x 28 BSP Baer® Round Die 262541214\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 11 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 1/8\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.383\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 9.73\",\n    \"Pitch: 28\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 0.907\",\n    \"Dimension: G (BSP) 1/8 x 28\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Thread standard: G (BSP): British Standard Pipe Thread according to DIN ISO 228 - Cylindrical pipe thread\",\n    \"Tolerance: A\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 5158\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 10 x 1,25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This thread cutting nut has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges on the inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Dies are commonly used in everyday life to make screws, nuts and threaded rods. The hexagon die nut is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind-hole threads in UNC No. 8 x 32. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect.

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting.

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool has an external hexagon and - depending on the size - has three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges take up the chips, roll them and carry them away. Hexagonal die nuts are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS hexagonal die nuts can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M16 X 1.5 Baer® HEX DIE - 262615402\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 14 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 16 mm\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.63\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 16\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5 mm\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 16 x 1.5\",\n    \"Material: HSS\",\n    \"Thread standard: MF: Metric ISO fine thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO-6g\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 382\"\n  ]\n}",

This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"UNF 10 x 32 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: No. 10\",\n    \"Pitch: 32\",\n    \"Dimension: UNF No. 10 x 32\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 7.24 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm². BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw. To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 18 x 1.5. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, an 18.5 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Sold out\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M18 X 1.5 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 18\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.5\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 18 x 1.5\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 27 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

The advantage of two-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with a ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the and brings the thread into shape. The finishing tap (No. 3) has no ring marking and cuts the remaining thread profile to produce the 100% full and usable thread. The division of labour between the two screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes. As a rule, two-piece hand taps- sets are used for fine threads with a smaller pitch than with coarse thread, as the thread profile surface is smaller than with coarse threads and the force effects on the taps are smaller.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M26 x 1.5 BAER HSSG Hand Tap Set (2pcs.)

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole and blind-hole threads in UNC No. 6 x 32. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Sold out\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1/8 x 40 BSW - HSS BAER Round Cutting Die\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 5 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 1/8\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.125\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 3.175\",\n    \"Pitch: 40\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 0.64\",\n    \"Dimension: BSW 1/8 x 40\",\n    \"Product group: Round cutting die\",\n    \"Product type: Round cutting dies\",\n    \"Thread standard: BSW: British Whitworth standard thread according to BS 84\",\n    \"Tolerance: medium\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 223 (DIN EN 2256)\",\n    \"Material: HSS\"\n  ]\n}",

BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping and guarantee a permanent fixed thread connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to handle. Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 14 x 1.25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. No tang breaker is included in this set. The tang can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tang. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M14 X 1.25 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 14\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 14 x 1.25\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 21 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the hand tap with oversize for insert threads, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. This set does not include twist drill bit and tang breaker. To drill the core hole, a 26.25 mm twist drill bit is still needed here. The tenon can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull the installation tool back after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tenon. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"UNC 1\\\" X 8 BaerCoil Kit\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 1\\\"\",\n    \"Pitch: 8\",\n    \"Dimension: UNC 1\\\" x 8\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 38.1 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

BAER dies are perfect for anyone who wants to cut external threads. Basically, this cutting tool is cylindrical and has - depending on the size - three or more cutting edges inside. The holes between the cutting edges receive the chips, roll them and discharge them. Dies are used to cut screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday use. Round dies are cylindrical and are used for making external threads in one operation. There are four holes and a groove on the outer casing of the round die, which are used to secure the die in matching die stock and holders using retaining screws. External threads are cut by hand with die stock. Special die holders are used for the tailstock on a lathe or for the chuck of a drill press. The tap is made of high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm². BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw. To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts.

Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes.

However, the finishing tap (No. 3) can also be used without a pre- or intermediate tap (No. 2) as it already cuts a fully usable thread. However, the short chamfer makes it more difficult to get straight into the hole and the tool life time is reduced compared to using multi-part hand tap sets. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut into a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, it can be used universally for through holes and blind holes.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in UNC 1/4 x 20. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources.

If you have damaged threads, the BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution - while maintaining the same nominal diameter! By reaming and inserting a new EC thread, your old thread becomes strong and stable again. With the BaerCoil® thread insert, your manufactured thread becomes significantly more stable than the original thread! BaerCoil® thread inserts are sophisticated design elements that ensure optimum power transmission from the bolt to the nut thread. They compensate for pitch and angular errors and thus distribute static and dynamic work loads evenly over all thread turns. This is particularly important in lightweight constructions where the carrier material is to be reduced. BaerCoil® thread inserts make it possible to use smaller and shorter screw connections. Today, they are already an important component in the aerospace and automotive industries.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind-hole threads in M 5 - 12. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair magazine contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand taps with oversize for insert threads, insertion tools, tang breakers and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. The BaerFix® self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes are ideal when you want to create a strong connection for materials that are difficult to machine. These inserts have a thicker wall and can therefore absorb more force, which is also distributed over three cutting holes. They are also the right choice if you do not need a screw locking effect. If a clamping effect is desired, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting slots.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1-FAL12 M12 x 1.75 x 12mm STST BaerFix® Inserts\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 12\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.75\",\n    \"Dimension: M 12 x 1.75\",\n    \"Product group: Self-cutting thread inserts\",\n    \"Speed guide value for light metals: 200-300 R/min\",\n    \"Product type: BaerFix self-cutting inserts with cutting holes\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO2/6H\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Type: with cutting holes\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel 1.4305 (AISI 303)\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in UNC 1/2 x 13. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid waste in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel.

With the BaerFix® thread repair set, damaged M 16 threads can be repaired quickly and easily. This set contains all the tools you need to achieve a permanent and strong anchorage in various materials. The BaerFix® thread repair set is ideal for materials such as aluminium, light metals, non-ferrous metals, brass, bronze, cast iron, plastics, laminates and hardwood. Please note that the set is only suitable for materials with a tensile strength up to approx. 450 N/mm². BaerFix® thread inserts are self-tapping, guarantee a permanently tight threaded connection in your workpiece and are extremely easy to use. Simply screw into the hole - the inserts cut the holding thread themselves. Once your thread is worn or torn out, a stable connection between the materials is no longer possible. This is where BaerFix® thread insert comes to the rescue. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair or strengthen damaged internal thread. Damaged threads in your components do not have to be rejects. Simply insert a threaded insert with the same internal thread into the component and your thread will not only be repaired, it will also be more pull-out resistant and wear resistant. The pull-out strength is higher than a class 8.8 screw. To assist with the repair, the set includes a core drill bit and an assembly tool in addition to the thread inserts.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 13 x 1.25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. No tang breaker is included in this set. The tang can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tang. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M13 X 1.25 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 13\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 13 x 1.25\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 19.5 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

Simply screw them into the hole - you cut the holding thread yourself. If your thread is worn or torn out, a stable material connection is no longer possible. This is where the BaerFix® self-tapping thread insert comes in. With our self-tapping thread inserts you can repair your broken internal thread or strengthen an existing thread. If there are damaged threads in your components, this does not have to be a waste. Simply insert a threaded bush with the same internal thread into the component, so that your thread is not only repaired, but can also be loaded at the same time with higher pull-out strength and is also more wear-resistant. With BaerFix® thread inserts you need fewer connecting parts, reduce the screw dimensions to be used, save material and space - and all this with low weight and high requirements. For many products, saving weight is an important factor. Thanks to the cutting slot, the thread inserts remain anchored in the workpiece even in the event of strong shocks or vibrations. The cutting slots can spring slightly inwards, so that there is an additional clamping effect for the screw. In many applications, this is advantageous for the design. If this effect is undesirable, we recommend our self-tapping thread inserts with cutting holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1-FE06 - M6 BAERFIX INSERTS 100Pck\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 6\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.0\",\n    \"Dimension: M 6 x 1.0\",\n    \"Product group: Self-cutting thread inserts\",\n    \"Product type: BaerFix self-cutting inserts with cutting slots\",\n    \"Thread standard: M: Metric ISO standard thread according to DIN 13\",\n    \"Tolerance: ISO2/6H\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Type: with cutting slots\",\n    \"Material: Case-hardened steel, galvanized\",\n    \"Maximum insertion torque: 15 Nm\",\n    \"Speed guide value for light metals: 280-400 R/min\",\n    \"Drilling depth: Min. drilling depth for through hole: 14.00 mm, Min. drilling depth for blind hole: 17.00 mm\"\n  ]\n}",

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 12 x 1.25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair kit contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool, tang breaker and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, according to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M12 X 1.25 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 12\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 12 x 1.25\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 18 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

The left-hand tapping hand tap set consists of three taps and enables you to cut a finished left-hand thread with significantly reduced risk of breakage. One left-hand thread is tapped counterclockwise. The left-hand tap or left-hand screw tap is also operated counterclockwise. The advantage of three-piece hand taps is that the respective parts of a set share the cutting power: The taper tap (No. 1) (marked with one ring) removes 65 per cent of the thread profile and the intermediate tap (No. 2) (marked with two rings) removes 85 per cent. Pre-cutting and reworking with the intermediate tap (No. 2) bring the thread into shape. In the last step, the finishing tap (No. 3) is used, which has no ring marking. Only this cuts the full and usable thread at the end. The division of labour between the three screw tap makes it easier to cut a straight and clean thread by hand. Compared to the machine tap, the hand tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole. Due to the short chamfer of the finish tap, the hand tap set can be used reliably and universally for through holes and blind holes. As a rule, three-piece hand taps- sets are used for regular threads with coarse pitch, as the thread profile area is larger than for fine threads and the force effects on the taps are greater.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1/4x20 UNC L/H TAP SET -\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 1/4\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in inches: 0.25\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 6.35\",\n    \"Pitch: 20\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1.27\",\n    \"Dimension: UNC 1/4 x 20\",\n    \"Square: 4.9 mm\",\n    \"Product group: Screw taps\",\n    \"Product type: Hand tap sets\",\n    \"Thread standard: UNC: American Unified National Coarse thread according to ANSI B1.1\",\n    \"Tolerance: 2B\",\n    \"Direction: Left\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 352\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: up to 900 N/mm² | 27.1 HRC\",\n    \"Material: HSSG bright\"\n  ]\n}",

It is equipped with four holes and a V-groove that secure the die in matching die stock and holders. This allows you to handle the die safely and comfortably. The BAER round die is also perfect for use in a tailstock or chuck of a drill press. Dies are tools used for cutting screws, nuts and threaded rods in everyday life. The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or drill press. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The tap is made of the high-speed steel HSS, which has better toughness and is less susceptible to breakage than HSSE steel. HSS steel is also a popular material for making tools that are subjected to high stresses. HSS cutting dies can be used for structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloyed copper and short-chipping copper-tin alloys.

With this BaerCoil® thread repair-set it is possible to repair through hole threads and blind hole threads in MF 14 x 1.25. BaerCoil® thread inserts are the best solution for all your thread repair needs! With them you are able to make durable and strong connections. With the inserts you avoid scrap in your components and can recycle them. The inserts are precise and wear resistant - your screw will stay firmly in place without the thread insert slipping out. The BaerCoil® thread insert is the perfect solution for damaged threads without changing the nominal diameter. For the thread repair with wire thread inserts, the thread is drilled out and a new STI thread (screw thread insert) is cut for the wire thread insert. This thread is often also called STI thread (STI=Screw Thread Insert). Then the BaerCoil® thread insert is screwed into the old thread and thus the workpieces are screwed back together. With BaerCoil® thread inserts, the thread produced is significantly more stable than the original thread. Our thread inserts ensure that both static and dynamic work loads are distributed evenly over the individual thread turns. In addition, the flexibility of the thread inserts compensates for possible pitch and angular errors, so that optimum force transmission from the bolt to the nut thread is achieved. Especially in lightweight constructions, BaerCoil® thread inserts help to save carrier material and to use smaller or shorter screw connections. They are already an important component in aviation and vehicle construction. They significantly save material and contribute to the conservation of resources. For repair directly on the thread, this thread repair set contains various auxiliary tools, such as the core drill bit, hand tap with oversize for insert thread, insertion tool and wire thread inserts made of stainless steel. No tang breaker is included in this set. The tang can be broken with the installation tool. To do this, pull back the installation tool after installation and turn it 90° so that it rests on the tang. Then strike the tool briefly at the back. BaerCoil® thread inserts can be shortened, if necessary, to the required length with a side cutter or similar.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"M14 X 1.25 BaerCoil Kit (Helicoil Type)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 14\",\n    \"Pitch: 1.25\",\n    \"Dimension: MF 14 x 1.25\",\n    \"Length: 1.5 D\",\n    \"T (Length when installed): 21 mm\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: >1400 N/mm²\",\n    \"Material: Stainless Steel V2A (AISI 304, X5CrNi18-10, Material No.: 1.4301)\",\n    \"Temperature resistance: 315°C long-term, 425°C short-term\"\n  ]\n}",

The die holder is used to cut the threads by hand and with the special die holders you can also attach the round die to a tailstock or drill press. The dies can usually be used on both sides and have a perfect cut. The external thread cutting tool is made of high-speed steel (HSS). HSS steel has a higher toughness and a lower susceptibility to breakage compared to HSSE steel. HSS steel is known for its exceptional cutting performance and durability. HSS cutting dies can be used for a wide range of applications, such as structural steels, carbon steels and free-cutting steels. It is also suitable for case-hardening steels and unalloyed tempering steels with a strength of up to 750 N/mm². Cast steel as well as zinc alloys can also be cut with it, as well as pure copper, low-alloy copper, as well as short-chipping copper-tin alloys, plastics such as POM, PVC, etc. It is important that you lubricate the tool plumbed working and with cutting oil or cutting paste.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"NPT 1/2 x 14 - HSS BAER Round Cutting Die\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Height H: 18 mm\",\n    \"Diameter: 1/2\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 21,22\",\n    \"Pitch: 14\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1,81\",\n    \"Dimension: NPT 1/2 x 14\",\n    \"Product group: Round cutting die\",\n    \"Product type: Round cutting dies\",\n    \"Thread standard: NPT: National Pipe Thread or American pipe thread according to ANSI B 1.20.1\",\n    \"Tolerance: medium\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: DIN 223 (DIN EN 2256)\",\n    \"Material: HSS\"\n  ]\n}",

Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming.

Short machine taps allow you to cut a finished thread with just one tool in one step, even by hand. Exact internal thread can be cut by hand or semi-professionally by machine to save time. Compared to the machine tap, the short machine tap has a short shank. This allows you to cut internal thread by hand without jamming and can be operated with tap wrenches, tool ratchets or other holding tools with square drive. The thread can be cut in a pre-drilled core hole and does not require any preparatory work by a taper tap (No. 1) or intermediate tap (No. 2). This internal tap clearly offers the price advantage over the hand tap set, as you no longer need two or three screw taps for thread cutting, but only one screw tap. The high time saving also significantly increases the efficiency of thread cutting. Due to the short chamfer and the straight flutes, chip is mainly absorbed by the flutes and is not removed during cutting. We recommend removing the chip from the flutes with a brush, compressed air or similar after each thread to prevent chip jamming. This chamfer form makes the screw tap reliable and universally applicable for through holes and blind holes.\",\n  \"availability\": \"Unavailable\",\n  \"product_name\": \"1/4 X 18 NPT MACHINE TAP - 266351419 (P124)\",\n  \"specifications\": [\n    \"Diameter: 1/4\",\n    \"Nominal diameter in mm: 13,62\",\n    \"Pitch: 18\",\n    \"Pitch in mm: 1,41\",\n    \"Dimension: NPT 1/4 x 18\",\n    \"Square: 9 mm\",\n    \"Product group: Screw taps\",\n    \"Product type: Short machine taps\",\n    \"Thread standard: NPT: National Pipe Thread or American pipe thread according to ANSI B 1.20.1\",\n    \"Tolerance: medium\",\n    \"Direction: Right\",\n    \"Standard: Factory standard\",\n    \"Tensile strength at room temperature: up to 900 N/mm² | 27.1 HRC\",\n    \"Material: HSSG bright\"\n  ]\n}",
