## SDS Plus Drill 6.5mm OL: 160mm WL: 100mm

{
  "price": "€6.99",
  "description": "These Faithfull high-performance, tungsten carbide tipped drill bits fit into SDS Plus chucks which provide a particularly secure, non-slip grip, that transmits maximum power for rotary percussion drilling, mainly into concrete. The SDS Plus bits ensure maximum power transmission due to their unique fluted shaft. This effectively removes situations where a perfectly serviceable cutting edge is rendered useless by a worn shank. The SDS Plus system also enables faster changing of drills using a quick-release keyless chuck. The drill bits are suitable for use in bricks, blocks, concrete containing aggregates, marble, hard stone and other hard masonry materials.",
