## Description

The Batavia FIXXPACK Ratchet Wrench tightens and loosens nuts and bolts more efficiently than hand ratchet wrenches. It can also be used as a ratchet without charge if needed. A variable speed trigger, which provides extra control over the tool.

Thanks to the compact design and the low-profile head, you can tighten and loosen nuts and bolts in hard to reach places. There is also a handy LED light, so you can always see where you are working, even under the hood of the car or in dimly lit environments.

Part of the FIXXPACK collection. Within the FIXXPACK collection you can use different power tools, with only one battery and charger.

Comes as a Bare Unit, NO battery or charger supplied.

Specifications:

Bit Holder: 3/8in.

No Load Speed: 0-300/min.

Max. Torque: 45Nm.
