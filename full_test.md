   - [ ] Check that diff extraction finds all added/removed products
   - [ ] Verify shard file reflects all changes correctly

4. **ElevenLabs Sync**
   - [ ] Verify document replacement handles multiple changes
   - [ ] Confirm final document contains all expected products
   - [ ] Check sync state is updated correctly

5. **Verification**
   - [ ] Verify all changes are reflected in final document
   - [ ] Test RAG functionality with updated product list

#### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ All product changes are processed correctly
- ‚úÖ Single document replacement handles multiple changes
