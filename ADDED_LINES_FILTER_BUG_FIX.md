# Added Lines Filter Bug Fix

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Issue:** Extracting wrong product - first product in diff instead of newly added product  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## üî¥ Problem Summary

The system was extracting **existing products** from the diff instead of the **newly added** product!

### Symptoms from Test:

**Webhook payload:**
- Category page: `https://www.jgengineering.ie/collections/bsp-helicoil-kits-ireland`
- New product in diff: `Test_Deburring_Item` ($12.00)
- Product URL in diff: `.../products/test_deburring_item`

**What was extracted:**
```
Found product URL in diff: https://www.jgengineering.ie/.../products/g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil
```

**Result in ElevenLabs:**
- ‚ùå Got 1 document (progress!)
- ‚ùå BUT it contained `G (BSP) 1'' x 11 BaerCoil Kit` ($323.00) 
- ‚ùå NOT `Test_Deburring_Item` ($12.00)

### Root Cause

The diff contains the **entire category page** with ALL products (existing + new):

```diff
 [![](image1.jpg)](https://...products/g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil)  ‚Üê EXISTING (shown as context)
 [G (BSP) 1'' x 11...](https://...products/g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil)
 ...
+[Test_Deburring_Item](https://...products/test_deburring_item)  ‚Üê NEW (added line)
+**$12.00** ~~~~
```

**The Problem:**
- My regex was searching the **entire diff text**
- It found the first product URL ‚Üí `g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil` (existing product)
- The new product `test_deburring_item` appeared later in the diff

I wasn't filtering for **added lines only** (lines starting with `+`)!

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

**Commit:** `4c8158d` - "fix: Only extract product URLs from added lines in diff"

### Key Changes to `_extract_product_url_from_diff()`:

1. **Filter Added Lines Only:**
   ```python
   # Split diff into lines and only process ADDED lines (start with +)
   added_lines = []
   for line in diff_text.split('\n'):
       if line.startswith('+') and not line.startswith('++'):  # + but not +++ (file marker)
           added_lines.append(line[1:])  # Remove the + prefix
   
   # Rejoin added lines for processing
   added_content = '\n'.join(added_lines)
   ```

2. **Search Only in Added Content:**
   ```python
   # Look for product URLs in the ADDED content only
   matches = re.findall(product_url_pattern, added_content)
   ```

3. **Same for Relative URLs:**
   ```python
   # Also try to find relative product URLs in ADDED lines only
   relative_matches = re.findall(relative_pattern, added_content)
   ```

### How It Works Now:

**Before:**
```
1. Search entire diff text for product URLs
2. Find first match: g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil (existing product) ‚ùå
3. Process wrong product
```

**After:**
```
1. Extract only lines starting with + from diff
2. Search ONLY in added content for product URLs
3. Find first match: test_deburring_item (new product) ‚úÖ
4. Process correct product
```

### Example:

**Input Diff:**
```diff
 [G (BSP) 1'' x 11...](https://...products/g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil)
 [G (BSP) 1/2 x 14...](https://...products/g-bsp-1-2-x-14-baercoil-kit-helicoil)
+[Test_Deburring_Item](https://...products/test_deburring_item)
+**$12.00** ~~~~
```

**Extracted Added Lines:**
```
[Test_Deburring_Item](https://...products/test_deburring_item)
**$12.00** ~~~~
```

**Extracted URL:**
```
https://www.jgengineering.ie/collections/bsp-helicoil-kits-ireland/products/test_deburring_item
```

## üéØ Expected Result

After this fix, when a `page_added` webhook is received:

1. ‚úÖ Detects category page URL
2. ‚úÖ Filters diff to only **added lines** (lines starting with `+`)
3. ‚úÖ Extracts product URL from added lines ‚Üí `test_deburring_item`
4. ‚úÖ Scrapes **only the new product**
5. ‚úÖ Uploads **1 file** to ElevenLabs with the correct product data

### Test Case:

**Category:** `collections/bsp-helicoil-kits-ireland`  
**Diff shows:** 8 existing products + 1 new product (`Test_Deburring_Item`)

**Old behavior:** 
- Extracted: `g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil` (first existing product)
- Uploaded: Wrong product to ElevenLabs

**New behavior:**
- Extracted: `test_deburring_item` (newly added product)
- Uploaded: Correct product to ElevenLabs

## üìù Testing

To test, trigger a new webhook from rivvy-observer and check:

```bash
# Check GitHub Actions logs
gh run list --limit 1
gh run view <run_id> --log | grep "Found product URL"

# Should see:
# "Found product URL in diff (from added lines): https://.../products/test_deburring_item"
# NOT: "Found product URL in diff: https://.../products/g-bsp-1-x-11-baercoil-kit-helicoil"
```

**Expected in ElevenLabs:**
```
Product: Test_Deburring_Item
Price: $12.00
Status: Sold out
```
